On PC-9821 Xe10 / Xa7 / 9/10, the PCM sound source of the main unit and the 86 sound of this board
It can not be used together with the function part (they compete with each other in INT 5).Also use SCSI function
In this case, do not use the second communication port on the main unit
Set to or change the INT 1 assigned to it.

Soft switch settings:
Perform settings such as interrupt level and DMA channel.
By turning on or reset while holding down [CTRL] + [GRPH] + [S] simultaneously
Call the setting screen.

HDD parameter analysis method by AI multi-vendor:
Press [CTRL] + [GRPH] + [P] simultaneously while checking SCSI ID at startup.
When the [analyze on] display appears, release the key from the key.
