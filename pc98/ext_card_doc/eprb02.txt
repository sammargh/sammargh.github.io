EP-RB02 (I・Oデータ)

Epson desktop machine, PC-486SE / SR / FE / FR / FS / MU / MR / MS / RS / MV built-in
RAM base board.This itself is 0 MB. 4 SIMM sockets on board, 8 dips
There is one switch and two rotary switches.
There are many operation reports on PC-486P / GR / GF etc. (*).In addition, SE / SR / FE / FR / FS officially
Is not allowed to be used on Windows 95, but it also works well in practice
There are many.The symptom of the problem is that you can not move forward when installing Windows 95
And if you install it, you can use it without any problems
Although I used this board at the time of installation of Windows 95, the fault was not recognized).
(*): For these models, turn on the extension switch 2-2 (system reservation: normally off)
　　　　By doing this, you will recognize memory of 14.6 MB or more.of course
　　　　RECMEM.SYS when using Windows 95 with at least 16 MB of memory
        Or write a driver with the equivalent function at the top of CONFIG.SYS
        It is necessary.
This board has more weight than Melco's ERF, as far as I have examined with PC-486P / SE / GR.
It seems that there are many.

・ 8 stations dip switch SW1
1: Designation of SIMM type to be attached to socket 1
　Attach ON = EP-SIM 327
　OFF = Attach SIMM of EPSON specification
Designation of the type of SIMM to be installed in each of 2, 3, 4: 2-4 sockets
　Attach ON = EP-SIM 327
　OFF = Attach EPSON SIMM or nothing
※ Actually, even if it is not EP-SIM327, SIMM-ID with up to 32MB of JEDEC specification
　In the case of SIMM, it can be used without parity / ECC, FP / EDO and others (in the case of EDO)
　Will operate in first page mode instead of hyper page mode
　Seem.See also Note 1 at the end of this content).However, with SIMM-ID
　If not, it will not be recognized normally (see Note 2 below).
　In addition, there is a limit to the total amount of memory that can be recognized by the main unit (PC-486SE / SR / FE / FR / FS
(And 486 P / GR / GF) 63.6 MB, and PC-486 MU / MR / MS / MV / RS 61.6 MB.
  The amount of memory beyond this limit is ignored.
5: Always off (system reservation)
6: Designation of machine type
　ON = PC-486SE / FE
　OFF = other models
※ ON seems to be a setting for a base clock 25 MHz machine, and this setting also applies to P and GR.
7: Always on (system reservation)
※ It seems that WAIT decreases when OFF.
8: Always off (system reservation)
※ It seems to be for EP-RB01 compatible setting.If you turn on the socket 1, 2, 3 and 4
　Do not recognize that they are not SIMMs of the same capacity and number of chips as a pair.

・ Rotary switch SW2, SW3: Designation of start address of EP-RB02
　Start to which EP-RB02 is assigned according to the memory capacity installed in the PC body
　Specify an address.
The following is the order of memory capacity counted at startup: SW2 SW3 Start address:
　1.6MB ■ 2 ■ 0 ■ 200000H ~
　3.6MB ■ 4 ■ 0 ■ 400000H ~
　5.6MB 6 6 0 H
　7.6MB ■ 8 ■ 0 ■ 800000H ~
　9.6 MB ■ A ■ 0 ■ A 00000 H ~
　11.6MB ■ C ■ 0 ■ C 00000 H ~
　13.6MB ■ E ■ 0 ■ E00000H ~
　15.6MB ■ 0 ■ 1 ■ 1000000H ~
※ When using more than 15.6 MB of memory, "use" the 16 MB system space of the main unit
　If you set it to, due to the specifications of the main unit, when actually counting memory, the memory actually expanded
　It is displayed 1 MB less than the capacity.In the above table, "15.6 MB" means 16 MB system space
　Amount of memory displayed when set to "Disconnect".

Note 1: Be careful with the socket when inserting multiple EDO SIMMs.
(1) When using two 32 MB EDO SIMMs, insert them into the adjacent sockets
　 If there is an NEC version of DOS6.2 himem.sys "reliable XMS memory 00200004h
   Display the message "I found it in". 1-3 or 2-4 away
   There is no error if you use sockets.However, in 2-3, it seems to pass the check.
　 Also, when 3 cards are inserted in a series of sockets, the "error" address is 0220,000 Ah
   It becomes.
(2) Insert a 32 MB EDO into Socket 1 and a 32 MB FP into Socket 2, respectively.
   A message of 00200004h appears.When inserted into the socket in reverse order, 00200008h
　 It becomes so.
(3) In the case of 16 MB EDO, when 2 sheets are inserted in the adjacent socket, 00200004h
   If two cards are attached to three consecutive sockets, 01200006h,
   In 2-3-4, 00200004h is displayed. When all is filled, 00200004h
   You will get an "error" message.
(4) When two 32 MB EDOs are inserted, SIMMs are also inserted in the two adjacent sockets
　 If there is, it fails to start.Specifically, "specified in the SYSTEM.INI file
   The device file is corrupt, and you will see the message:
   The files "broken" are dynapage, vpd, int13, vkd, enable, VPICD,
   VDMAD, VTD, etc., but insert the same SIMM into one of the sockets 1-3, 1-4, 2-4
   Fix it and start it up again. Windows 95 will start up normally.
　However, when it is inserted into the socket 2-3, it seems to stand up normally.
From the above, when inserting two 16 MB or 32 MB EDO SIMMs into EP-RB02, sockets 1 and 3
Or 2 and 4 should be used.

Note 2: There is a report that SIMMs without SIMM-ID recognize only 1⁄4 of the capacity.
     But that's not the case, if you get 8MB x 2 and get 6MB, or insert multiple SIMMs,
     Some phenomena such as different capacity recognized at the socket position were also observed.
     In addition, even if it is SIMM-ID without SIMM-ID, even if it is mixed, it will not be recognized normally absolutely.
     This is exactly the same for Melco's ERF.
