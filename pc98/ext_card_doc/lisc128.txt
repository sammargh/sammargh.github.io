All models.
　* Make the clock number 10 MHz in PC-9801 RX.
　※ ※ Can not be used in high resolution mode.In the manual, compatible models include PC-98XA
　　　It would be a mistake.

　OFF-OFF-OFF-ON INT 3 (Factory setting) Setting of ROM address and I / O base address
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　 In the case of 1, 3
　* When using with SCSI I / F, set the interrupt number to INT 3 and set the SCSI I / F interrupt number
　　Set to something other than INT 3.
5-6: ROM address and I / O base address setting

　　　　　　 Bp, Bs, Be, Bf, Ts 1 (recommended setting), 2
　　　Models other than the above ■ 1, 2, 3 (recommended setting)
