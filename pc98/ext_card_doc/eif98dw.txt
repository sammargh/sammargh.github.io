EIF-98DW, EIF-98DW2 (ELECOM)

C bus super FIFO transfer SCSI-2 board.There are three 8-deep dip switches on the board.

| In ELECOM's fax service, the explanation of 4-5-6-7-8 for SW2 and 1-2-3-4 for SW3 are missing.About SW2 |
There is a description that 4-5 is the setting of ROM address in high resolution mode, and the factory setting of |
| Since the sequence of dip switches is the same as EIF-98SW, also for 6-7-8 EIF- |
| It is assumed that it will be the same as 98SW.With regard to SW3, either of 1-2-3-4 |
It seems that I / O page address setting is done, and it is also taken when scanning the manual |
As long as you look at the back reflection of the corresponding page of the embedded manual, it is also the same as EIF-98SW.
It seems to be |                                                     |

Although the final ROM seems to be 2.30, it does not correspond to HDD of 1GB or more as it is, but with EIF-98DW
It is possible to correspond by the version upgrade of ROM.In the old web page of ELECOM
Because expression is vague, it is not clear whether EIF-98DW2 supports HDD of 1GB or more
(For other boards, the correspondence table indicates whether or not the ROM version can be upgraded.
"None" is written in the remarks section of, but this means that it corresponds as it is
I wonder).
In addition, ELECOM makes EIF-98DW non-compliant with Windows 95, while EIF-98DW2 makes DMA transfer only.
It is supported (it works with 55 drivers) but it is compatible with Windows 95.

・ 8-station dip switch SW1: SCSI-ID of board, interrupt level, setting of DMA channel
1-2-3: Board SCSI-ID setting
  OFF-OFF-OFF: ID = 0
  ON-OFF-OFF: ID = 1
  OFF-ON-OFF: ID = 2
  ON-ON-OFF: ID = 3
  OFF-OFF-ON: ID = 4
  ON-OFF-ON: ID = 5
  OFF-ON-ON: ID = 6
  ON-ON-ON: ID = 7 (factory setting)
4-5-6: Setting interrupt level
  OFF-OFF-OFF: INT 0 (factory setting)
  ON-OFF-OFF: INT 1
  OFF-ON-OFF: INT 2
  ON-ON-OFF: INT 3
  OFF-OFF-ON: INT 5
  ON-OFF-ON: INT 6
7-8: DMA channel
  OFF-OFF: DMA 0
  OFF-ON: DMA 2 (available only for PC-9801E / F / U / UF / XA)
  ON-ON: DMA 3 (factory setting)

・ 8 stations dip switch SW2: ROM address (, body model, SCSI BIOS enabled / disabled?)settings of
1-2-3: Normal mode ROM address setting
  OFF-OFF-OFF: D0000h to D0FFFh
  ON-OFF-OFF: D2000h to D2FFFh
  OFF-ON-OFF: D4000h to D4FFFh
  ON-ON-OFF: D6000h to D6FFFh
  OFF-OFF-ON: D 8000 h to D 8 FFF h
  ON-OFF-ON: DA000h to DAFFFh
  OFF-ON-ON: DC000h to DCFFFh (factory setting)
  ON-ON-ON: DE000 to DEFFFh
  ※ Due to the ROM address, simultaneous use of this board, EMS and sound functions is not possible.
  　Also, when using with PC-9801 E / F / M, set D4000h to D4FFFh.
■■■■■■■ For the following 4-5-6-7-8, it is a guess from the setting of EIF-98SW ■■■■■
4-5: Setting ROM address in high resolution mode
  OFF-OFF: XE8000h to XE8FFFh
  ON-OFF: XEA000h to XEAFFFh
  OFF-ON: XEC000h to XECFFFh (factory setting)
  ON-ON: XEE000h to XEEFFFh
  ※ "X" represents "0H" or "FH"
6-7: Setting of main unit model [Estimate from setting of EIF-98SW]
  ON-OFF: CPU is the model of 8086 or V30
  ON-ON: Model with only 286 CPUs in normal mode only (default setting)
  OFF-OFF: PC-98XA (high res dedicated model)
  OFF-ON: Model with both normal mode and high resolution mode, high resolution board
          Installed model
8: Enable / Disable of SCSI_BIOS [inferred from setting of EIF-98SW]
  ON: SCSI_BIOS enabled (factory setting)
  OFF: SCSI_BIOS disabled

・ 8-station dip switch SW3: I / O page address, transfer mode setting
■■■■■■■ The following 1-2-3-4 is the guess from the setting of EIF-98SW.
1-2: I / O page address setting
  OFF-OFF: CC0H
  ON-OFF: CD0H
  OFF-ON: CE0H
  ON-ON: CF0H (factory setting)
3-4: ON-ON-ON (System reservation, change prohibited)
-----------------------------------------------------
5: Transfer mode setting
  ON: Automatically switch DMA / Super FIFO transfer depending on CPU type (factory setting)
  OFF: Forced DMA transfer
    ※ It is used in advanced mode with Epson PC (when used in normal mode
    DMA transfer).When using OS / 2, super FIFO mode is released automatically.
6-7-8: OFF-ON-ON (undefined, change prohibited)
