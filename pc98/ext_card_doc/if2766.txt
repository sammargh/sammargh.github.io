IF-2766 (ICM)

Multi-vendor non-compliant C bus bus master SCSI I / F. Windows 95 compatible.
Two 8-deep dip switches and one 4-deep dip switch on the board
There is one jumper switch.

· 8 stations dip switch SW1: SCSI-ID, interrupt level, DMA channel

・ 8 stations dip switch SW2: Setting of main unit model
1-2-3-4-5-6-7: Setting of main unit (x can be ON or OFF)
Below, 1-2-3-4-5-6-7 ■ Main body model ■ SCSI-ROM address in order
　xxx-OFF-ON-OFF-OFF PC-98XA 0EC 000 h to 0 ECFFF h
　OFF-ON-ON-OFF-ON-OFF-ON
                         ■ In normal mode: 0DC000h to 0DCFFFh
                         / In high resolution mode: 0EC000h to 0ECFFFh
　OFF-ON-ON-xx-ON-ON ■ Model only in normal mode
                     ■ 0DC000h to 0DCFFFFh (factory setting)
※ 1-2-3-4-5 is the setting of the local memory address, 6-7 is the reason depending on the main unit.
8: Always ON (off seems to be off SCSI-ROM)

・ 4 stations dip switch SW3: I / O port address, transfer mode setting
1-2: I / O port address setting
　ON-ON 0 CCxh (factory setting)
　OFF-ON 0CDxh
　ON-OFF 0 C Exh
　OFF-OFF 0CFxh
3-4: Transfer mode setting
　OFF-ON ■ Synchronous bus master transfer
　ON-ON asynchronous bus master transfer
　ON-OFF FIFO transfer
　OFF-OFF DMA transfer
* Jumper switch JP2 is shorted during synchronous bus master transfer.
※ Details of the factory setting of transfer mode are unknown.Bus master and FIFO
　It seems that there was a case.
