Power Window 964LB (Canopus)

For mate A with S3 company 86C964 (Vision 964) on the graphics chip
Local bus GA. VRAM capacity is 2MB and 4MB.VRAM is
The 2MB version is a 2MB VRAM expansion sub board 962-2M (model number 9642M, on the surface
4MB can be realized by Power Window VRAM (with 4MB characters),
It is said that single acquisition of this sub-board is nearly impossible.
Maximum power consumption: + 5V, 2.0A (at VRAM 2MB) / + 5V, 2.9A (at VRAM 4MB)
　　　　　　　Do not use other local bus boards together with VRAM 4MB.
Operating environment: Temperature 10-35 ° C / humidity 20-80% (thing without dew condensation)
Memory space: Use 16MB of xx000000h to xxFFFFFFh. xx is a dip switch
　　　　　　Can be specified from 00h to FFh.
There is one 8-station dip switch on the board.

・ 8 stations dip switch S2: Memory space specification
If you look at the board to the right with the local bus connector, S2 is inverted and the dip is
The sequence of bits is 8-7-6-5-4-3-2-1, but the sequence of bits viewed as OFF = 1 and ON = 0 is memory.
It corresponds to the binary notation of xx in the space xx000000h to xxFFFFFFh.For example, factory setting
8-7-6-5-4-3-2-1 is OFF-OFF-OFF-OFF-ON-ON-ON-ON.
This is 1-1-1-1-0-0-0-0 in binary and F0h in hexadecimal (so
The factory setting of the memory space is F0000000h to F0FFFFFFh).

When using with other local bus boards, use the software called PW10 for memory
You can check for space overlap.
