IF-55B (TEAC)

C bus bus master SCSI board.Two x 3 jumper switches and 2 x 4 stations on the board
There is also a jumper switch, two 8-deep dip switches and one 5-deep dip switch.

・ 2 x 3 jumper switch JP1: Supply of terminator power (Factory setting: 3-5,
　4-6 shorts)

　4-5 shorts)
　※ ASCII book section edition, PC-98 series peripheral equipment super tune up (1994
　　In the figure on page 193 of the year issue, it is a short between 4-6, but an error between 4-5
　　Will.
