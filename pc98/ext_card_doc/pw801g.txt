Power Window 801G, 928G, 928II (Canopus)

C bus graphic accelerator board.Graphics chip is Power Window 801G
The S3 company 86C801 is installed, and the Power Window 928G and 928II are equipped with the S3 company 86C928.
There is one quadruple dip switch and one jumper switch on the board (in Power Window 801G
Is no jumper switch).In addition, memory capacity jumper switch in Power Window 928G
There is also.VRAM is 1 MB for Power Window 801G and 928G, and 2 MB for 928 II. Power Window 928G
The VRAM can be expanded to 2 MB with the VRAM expansion kit 928G-1M (model number HIM-1161-01).
If you look at the board with the card edge connector side on the left side of the board,
The damper is near the right corner of the board, and the memory capacity jumper is at the center of the board at the upper left.
The maximum current consumption is +5 V, 840 mA / + 12 V, 40 mA, 928 G in Power Window 801 G.
+5 V, 970 mA / + 12 V, 40 mA, +5 V, 940 mA / + 12 V, 40 mA for 928 II.

Operation is not guaranteed on machines with CPU accelerator (Operation of machines with ODP is guaranteed).

The main unit's GCD clock should be used at 5 MHz.14.6 MB or more of memory is installed in PC-98 series
If it is, set 16MB system space to "Use".It is equipped with PC-H98 series
If the mounted memory is 14.8 MB or more, the display of 16.77 million colors is not possible when using Power Window 801G.Also
In PC-9801FA, the number of expansions of 61 compatible SIMMs on the internal expansion RAM board is 5 or less (mounted memory 13.6 MB
Use in the following).

Standard I / O port address:
06D0-06DF, 16D0-16DF, 26D-26DF, 36D0-36DF
46D0-46DF, 56D0-56DF, 66D-66DF, 76D0-76DF
86D0-86DF, 96D0-96DF, A6D-A6DF, B6D0-B6DF
C6D0-C6DF, D6D0-D6DF, E6D-E6DF, F6D0-F6DF

The second digit from the left of each I / O port address "6"
, And can be changed between 1-7. 
The standard setting for the 4-station dip switch is ON-OFF-OFF-ON.
The dip switch supports binary numbers with ON = 0 and OFF = 1.For example,
ON-OFF-OFF-ON is "0110", which is "6" in hexadecimal. 
Software called "PWIO.EXE" to find out how to set the dip switch
Included.This is done before setting the board to the PC.
On LAN boards where the I / O port address to be used overlaps with Power Window, execute PWIO.EXE.
There is a possibility that the line will cause a malfunction.In this case, with the LAN cable disconnected
Run PWIO.EXE. 

The memory space uses 128KB from F00000H by default (within the system reserved area).
However, when using Power Window via I / O expansion unit, PC-H98 series
This memory space is used when the PC-486 series is equipped with a memory of 14.6 MB or more.
Unavailable.In this case, use Auto Setup to check the memory space and use it.
If it is, do the setting.When using manual setup, use I / O expansion unit
If you can not use the memory space such as time, select "Use extension unit"
about.However, the display of 16.77 million colors is not possible, and the drawing speed is slightly reduced. 
(In addition to the setting to use 128KB from F00000H for the manual, 128KB from E00000H
It is also possible to set to use or not to use

Jumper switch: The display is brighter than when the Power Window is not used
If it feels too much, remove the jumper plug (short plug).

Memory capacity jumper switch: Open when expansion VRAM is not expanded, when expansion
Is short. 
After VRAM expansion, check the expanded VRAM by PWMEM.EXE.In addition, after expansion
Setup the board (return to the original resolution of PWSET.EXE before
Do)).
