ET / T-98 (I・Oデータ)

C bus NIC (LAN board) with 10BASE-T connector.Not compatible with PnP,
It is said to be the most difficult thing in C bus NIC history.Dip switch on board
There is no kind, settings are done on DOS using the attached software, but manual
Occupies an address other than the I / O port address described in
If you want to use the model with PCI slot in default condition,
Conflict between PCI board (SCSI, GA) and I / O port address
There is.Occupied port address is also in the PCI setup utility
It can not be investigated, and it is accurate from the device manager of Windows 95
I can not grasp.

As a workaround for the I / O port address conflict, this board manual
Change the start address on the PCI board side from 6000h to 6100h, but
In this method, a conflict occurs at 61D0h.So PCI setup
Select the PCI bus slot = Automatic status in the utility and select I / O.
Set the start address of the port address to 6200h.Setting is "fixed"
Confirm that it has changed toThis workaround is for the I / O data web page
It is also described in the Q & A collection.According to the Q & A collection, the start address of ET / T-98
Are 00D0h, the occupied addresses are x0D0h, x1D0h (x = 0 to F), 02D0h.
That is,
00D0h, 01DOh, 10D0h, 11D0h, 20D0h, 21D0h, 30D0h, 31D0h, 40D0h,
41D0h, 50D0h, 51D0h, 60D0h, 61D0h, 70D0h, 71D0h, 80D0h, 81D0h,
90D0h, 91D0h, A0D0h, A1D0h, B0D0h, B1D0h, C0D0h, C1D0h, D0D0h,
D1D0h, E0D0h, E1D0h, F0D0h, F1D0h, 02D0h
※ When changed to 00D8h, replace 0 at the end with 8

Supports full-duplex communication, but set the half / full duplex settings to the supplied software
Use DOS to do it.However, because auto negotiation is not supported,
Manual setting with dip switch is possible for full duplex communication
Requires switching HUB.
