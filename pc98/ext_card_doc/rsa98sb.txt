RSA-98SB (I･Oデータ)

Second bus high-speed RS-232C expansion board (start-stop synchronization).Equipped with 1 serial port.For send / receive
Equipped with 2048 Byte FIFO (total 8 KB).There are two 8-deep dip switches on the board.
The TL16C550C manufactured by TEXAS INSTRUMENTS is used as the serial control LSI, with a transfer speed of up to 230.4 Kbps
Communication is possible (master clock 14.7456 MHz).The data bus is DB0-7.Maximum power consumption + 5V, 500mA / + 12V,
20 mA / -12 V, 2 w 0 mA. Operating environment: temperature 0-40 ° C / humidity 20-80% (no condensation).In the expansion I / O unit
Use is also possible.
Additional RS-232C port can be added by using multiple RSA-98, RSA-98SB and RSA-98II / S.In attached BIOS
Up to 32 RS-232C ports can be controlled with up to 32 lines, or with COM driver for Windows 3.1 up to 7 lines (Windows NT
COM driver for 3.5x and Windows 95 supports only one RSA-98 series: Windows NT 3.5x and
Multiple use of RSA-98, RSA-98SB and RSA-98II / S is not possible on Windows 95).
Set up and use flow control to prevent data loss.Enable hard flow control
In order to do this, always use a cable with RTS / CTS and DTR / DSR signal lines connected.

・ 8-station dip switch SW2: Setting of upper 8 bits of I / O port address
The dip corresponds to the binary bit pattern.
When 8 dips are divided into 4 pieces, hexadecimal numbers will be used in both 4-3-2-1 in the first half and 8-7-6-5 in the second half.
The correspondence between the and dip patterns is as follows:
0 ■ OFF-OFF-OFF-OFF
1 ■ OFF-OFF-OFF-ON
2 ■ OFF-OFF-ON-OFF
3 ■ OFF-OFF-ON-ON
4 ■ OFF-ON-OFF-OFF
5 ■ OFF-ON-OFF-ON
6 ■ OFF-ON-ON-OFF
7 ■ OFF-ON-ON-ON
8 ■ ON-OFF-OFF-OFF
9 ■ ON-OFF-OFF-ON
A ON-OFF-ON-OFF
B ON-OFF-ON-ON
C ON-ON-OFF-OFF
D ON-ON-OFF-ON
E ■ ON-ON-ON-OFF
F ON-ON-ON-ON
Example) When setting to 50h, set 5-6-7-8 to OFF-ON-OFF-ON, and set 1-2-3-4 to OFF-OFF-OFF-OFF.
Set.The factory setting is 50h.
Note 1: In the PC-9821 series, since the upper 8 bits x8h to xFh of the I / O port address are reserved,
　　 Set in the range of x0h to x7h.
Note 2: This description is in accordance with the RSA-98 Series Instruction Manual (issued on March 4, 1996).
     In the SW1 diagram on the page, to set "OFF", the dip switch should be shifted to the "ON" side.
     (In the manual of RAS-98, it is not written which black and white rectangle represents dip switch
　　 However, judging from the description of the other board's manual of I · O data, the black rectangle in this board dips
     It seems to indicate the switch).

The lower 8 bits of the I / O port address are fixed by hardware as follows.
(1) TL16C550C control port
   xxE0h, xxE2h, xxE4h, xxE6h, xxE8h, xxEAh, xxECh, xxEEh
   xxE1h, xxE3h, xxE5h, xxE7h, xxE9h, xxEBh, xxEDh, xxEFh
(2) Port address for transmission / reception FIFO
   xxD0h, xxD2h, xxD4h, xxD6h
   xxD1h, xxD3h, xxD5h, xxD7h
(In short, the lower 8 bits are fixed at D0h to D7h and E0h to EFh)
※ When used with GA-98NB series, the I / O port address will be duplicated if it is the factory setting (50h) and normal
　Do not work.In this case, the upper 8 bits of the base I / O port address of RSA-98 other than 40h to 5Fh (GA-98 NBI / C
　When using in combination with this, please set it so as not to overlap with other boards.

About COM driver
(1) COM driver for Windows 95
-The base I / O port address of RSA-98 is fixed at 50h at the factory setting.
-"Multifunction Adapter" and "Extended Serial Board (RSA-98)" in Device Manager
　Click in the order of.Then set both ports to the same IRQ in "Properties".
・ After setup, "Extended serial board" (RSA-98) (COM 2) and "Extended serial board"
　(RSA-98) (COM3) is registered and it is COM3!There is a mark, but there is no problem in operation.
(2) COM driver for Windows NT3.x
・ The base I / O port address of RSA-98 is fixed to factory default 50h, and the interrupt level is fixed to INT 0.
　It is done.
・ When copying of driver files is completed, in [Mouse:] of [Windows NT setup]
　[I-O-DATA high-speed serial board RSA-98 series] is displayed, but it ends as it is.
　After rebooting, change [Mouse:] to [Use PC-9800 mouse].
When using these drivers, use the RSA-98 series BIOS or RSA-98 series serial driver.
Do not incorporate.
※ It is abbreviation about BIOS / driver for MS-DOS, Windows 3.1.
