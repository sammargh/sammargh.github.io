C bus expansion BOX connected to 110 pin expansion bus connector of old 98 note.
Two C bus slots are for NOTE-PAC (98) H-2A / 2B, NOTE-PAC (98) H-4A / 4B
Here are four.Externally attached FDD connector (amphenol full pitch 50 pin)
It has one.
-2A / -4A 10-in DIP switch beside the external FDD connector inside the side
For 1 piece or -2B / -4B, 8 dips on the side of the external FDD connector inside the side
There is one switch.

・ 10 stations / 8 stations dip switch: The state of the switch lever of the expansion board
　Specification, specification of body model, specification of memory address
1-2-3-4: Specification of switch lever status of expansion board
　The dips 1, 2, 3, 4 correspond to the C bus slots 1, 3, 2, 4 respectively.
　It corresponds to the slot where the board which uses the switch lever is installed
　Board is installed that does not use the switch lever, with dip turned on
　Set the dip corresponding to the slot to OFF. -2A and -2B for dips
　It seems that 2 and 4 are set to 1 and 3 and the opposite state respectively.

Since this setting table is based on the description of the NOTE-PAC (98) H-2B / 4B manual,
The settings for dips 9 and 10 of -2A and -4A are unknown.I have seen so far
Both of the two -2A were off-off.
