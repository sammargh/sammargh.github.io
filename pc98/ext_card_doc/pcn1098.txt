PCN-1098 (Neologue Electronics (now PC technology))

Digital I / O board for C bus. Two μPD8255AC-5 mounted, byte unit (8 bits)
6-bit 8-bit parallel port for word input / output (16 bits)
Power can use 3 16-bit ports.Supply current is +5 V, 160 mA (TYP), but
Without the optional buffer (SN74LS245).Operating temperature 0 to 35 °.The connector is
Two 34-pin males, CN1 (corresponds to "AL") and CN2 (corresponds to "AH") on the board.Fit
Connectors are Yamaichi FAS-34-03B or equivalent.4 stations dip switch on the board
There is one and one 8-link jumper switch.

The address configuration is as follows:
(MBS) (LBS)
　A7-A6-A5-A4-A3-A2-A1-A0
　A7: System code (always 1)
　A6 to A3: Device number (set by dip switch)
　A2 to A0: Order code

Order code:
Below, A2-A1-A0 ■ Port and register name ■ Designation of μPD8255 AC-5 ■ Order of connector
0-0- 0 ■ A port ■ AL ■ CN1
0-0-1 A port AH CN2
0-1-0 B port AL CN 1
0-1-1 B port AH CN2
1-0-0 ■ C port AL AL CN CN1
1-0-1 C port AH CN2
1-1-0 ■ Control register ■ AL ■ CN1
1-1-1 ■ Control register ■ AH ■ CN2

I / O operation
1. 8-bit input / output
　 Set the control word of the μPD8255 AC-5 separately on the AL and AH sides.
2. 16-bit input / output
   16-bit data is high-order (D15 to D8) and μ-side on μPD8255AC-5 on the AH side.
　 It is divided and output to the μPD8255AC-5 in the lower order (D7 to D0).Therefore, μPD8255AC-5
　 Set the same control word on AL and AH side.
   The following is the order of the 16-bit port name ■ upper (CN 2) ■ lower (CN 1)
　 A 16-bit port AH A port AL A port
　 B 16-bit port AH B port AL B port
　 C 16-bit port AH C port AL C port
   Other combinations are not allowed for 16-bit ports.

　OFF-OFF-OFF-ON: 88H-8FH
　OFF-OFF-ON-OFF: 90H to 97H

Buffer area (optional)
A buffer area is provided between each port and connector of the μPD8255AC-5.
If you need a buffer, implement the SN74LS245.The SN74LS245 is bi-directional
It can not be either input or output.
The following is the specification of μPD8255 AC-5 ■ Port name ■ Buffer area name ■ Pull-up module
Resistance ■ Cut pattern name (solder side) ■ Order of ceramic capacitor mounting position
AL A RA 1 JV 4, JG 4 RM 1 RA 1 C 7
AL B 1 RB 1 JV 5, JG 5 RM 2 RB 1 C 8
AL C RC 1 JV 6 JG 6 RM 3 RC 1 C 9
AH, A, RA2, JV1, JG1, RM4, RA2, C10
AH B B RB 2 JV 2, JG 2 RM 5 RB 2 C 11
AH C C RC 2 JV 3, JG 3 RM 6 RC 2 C 12
Implementation method of SN74LS245:
(1) Remove the pull-up module resistance of the port requiring the buffer.Nipper
　 Use a solder wicker or cut off the leg with a hand.
(2) Cut the pattern on the solder side of the buffer area where the buffer is to be mounted.
   The pattern cut is the eight patterns inside the square marked CUT on the solder surface.
(3) Implement the SN74LS245.After confirming the direction of the IC, soldering.
(4) Determine the SN74LS245 input / output direction.JV corresponding to each buffer area or
　 Jump on JG.
　 Jumper JV: Output only
　 Jumper JG: input only
(5) A 0.01 μF or 0.1 μF ceramic capacitor is mounted where the buffer is mounted.
