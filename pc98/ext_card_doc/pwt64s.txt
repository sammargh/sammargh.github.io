Power Window T64S (Canopus) 

S3 Trio 64 for graphic chip, ESS 688 for PCM sound source (compatible with Sound Blaster Pro)
Combined C bus board with graphic accelerator + sound source (Note) equipped with.Image memory
2 MB. From the left, the 3.5φ mini jack on the back of the board has speaker / headphone connection
Terminal, line input terminal 2, line input terminal 1, microphone input terminal.Power Window internal circuit
If the speaker / headphone terminal has a monaural mini plug, the
Never connect speakers or headphones (earphones).Consumption current is
+12 V = 65 mA, +5 V = 1.1 A.I. Two 4 dip switches and 4 double jumper switches on the board
Yes.
Note: The YAMAHA YMF-262-M, which is an FM sound generator chip, is also installed, but the details are unknown.

If you look at the board with the card edge up, the dip switch on the upper left of the board is S1, upper right
Dip switch is S2, its lower left (upper left of ESS 688) jumper switch is JP7,
The jumper switch on the bottom right of the ESS688 is JP9, and the bottom right of the Trio 64 / bottom left of the ESS688 / line
The two jumper switches on input terminal 1 are JP5 on the top and JP6 on the bottom.

Jumper switch:
・ JP5, JP6: Setting sound output level
　　Short + short = sound output level high
　　Open + open = sound output level low (when headphones etc. are used regularly,
　　　　　　　　　　　　Set as required)
・ JP7: Use / non-use of sound function
　　Open = Use sound function
　　Short = no sound function
・ JP9: When connecting a condenser microphone that requires a bias voltage to the microphone input terminal
　　short.

DIP switch:

Check to see if there is a overlap.The I / O address used by the Power Window sound function is also included.
To check, start the PWIO.exe with the / s switch.
Some LAN boards have an I / O port address that overlaps with the Power Window.like this
In the case of a board, execution of PWIO.exe may cause the LAN board to malfunction, so LAN
Run PWIO.exe after unplugging the cable from the board.Available settings after executing PWIO.exe
When is displayed, you may reconnect the LAN cable.
PWIO.exe is correct if there is a board or driver not activated at the time of check
It is recommended to use it as a guide as it may not be recognized.
