PC98 M44 (Caravelle)

C bus composite board with non-multi-vendor bus master SCSI-2 function and sound function.
Not compatible with Win95.Four 8 series dip switches on the board and 4 series june passes
Switch, Dual Jumper Switch, Three Jumper Switch, Two Jumper Switch
There is one each.
The sound function unit is controlled by the attached AUDIOPAC.COM.The audio file is Kano
In addition to audio files in the form of pause, WAVE is also supported.Sound function unit
Can not be practically used.

・ 8-station dip switch SW1: SCSI_ID, interrupt level, DMA channel setting
1-2-3: SCSI_ID
　ON-ON-ON: ID = 7 (factory setting)
4-5-6: Interrupt level
　OFF-OFF-OFF: INT0 (IRQ3)
　ON-OFF-OFF: INT1 (IRQ5)
　OFF-ON-OFF: INT2 (IRQ6)
　ON-ON-OFF: INT3 (IRQ9)
　OFF-OFF-ON: INT5 (IRQ12)
　ON-OFF-ON: INT6 (IRQ13)
7-8: DMA channel
　OFF-OFF: DMA0
　ON-ON: DMA3

・ 8-station dip switch SW2: Local memory address, specification of main unit model
1-2-3: Local memory address in normal mode
　OFF-ON-ON: \ DC000- \ DCFFF
4-5: Local memory address in high resolution mode
　OFF-ON: \ EC000- \ ECFFF
※ In model supporting both normal mode, high res mode
　1-2-3-4-5 All settings.
※ OFF-ON-OFF-OFF-ON for PC-286L, LE, LF (use of extended I / O box), LP
　Set to.
6-7: Main unit model
　ON-ON: Model in normal mode that supports protected mode
　ON-OFF: PC-9801VF, VM, UF, UR, UV, CV, N, NV (N, NV are expanded I / O boxes
　　　　　, PC-286U (does not support protected mode)
　　　　　Model)
　OFF-ON: PC-98XL, XL ^ 2, RL, PC-H98 (Normal mode and high res
　　　　　Models that support both modes)
　OFF-OFF: PC-98XA (model only in high res mode)　
8: Always on

・ 8-station dip switch SW3: I / O address, setting of forced DMA mode
1-2: I / O address
　ON-ON: CC0, CC2, CC4
　OFF-ON: CD0, CD2, CD4
　ON-OFF: CE0, CE2, CE4
　OFF-OFF: CF0, CF2, CF4
3-4: Always on
5: Forced DMA mode
　ON: Bus master transfer mode (factory setting, usually do not change)
　OFF: Forced DMA mode
※ We set bus master transfer mode in model equipped with CPU before 80286
　Even if you do, it will be DMA transfer.
6-7-8: Always OFF-ON-OFF

・ 4 series jumper switch SW4: Setting of hold request channel
　1, 3 short, 2, 4 open: hold request channel 1
                             (Factory setting)
　1, 3 open, 2, 4 short: hold request channel 2

・ Double jumper switch SW5: Do not change
　1 short, 2 open

・ 8 stations dip switch DS1: I / O port start of sound function part
　Address setting
Each dip (ON = 0, OFF = 1) of the switch is the upper address of the port.
Correspond to each bit (lower 2 digits of port address fixed to 18h).
The factory default setting is OFF-OFF-OFF-ON-ON-ON-OFF-ON (1-2-3 always
OFF-OFF-OFF): 4718 h (in this case, 4718 h-471 Fh is used)
If the I / O port address has been changed from the factory setting, AUDIOPAQ.COM
You need to enter the value at runtime.
※ The interrupt level (factory setting = INT1) is an option at driver startup
　Set by switch.

・ Setting method of 2 jumper switch (J1) and 3 jumper switch (J2)
　Is unknown (it seems to be all open by default)

※ This board and EMS additional RAM board, FM sound board
　Simultaneous use is not possible.In addition, the start address of the expanded RAM board EMS
　Is set to \ C0000.
