WSN-V2, WSN-V2M, WSN-V4 (メルコ)

S3 Trio 64 V (86 C 765) for graphic controller and Yamaha for FM sound source
C bus window accelerator equipped with crystal CS4231 in YMF288, PCM sound source
And PCM sound source combined board.WSN-V2 and WSN-V2M are image memory 2 MB, WSN-V4 is image memory
4 MB. WSN-V2M is an implementation of MPEG playback add-on board (MBO-D) on WSN-V2.
MBO-D is required to perform MPEG playback by hardware on WSN-V2 and WSN-V4.
Supports the DPMA method (on / off / suspend mode) proposed by VESA.DCI (Display
Support Control Interface) by hardware.Also Direct X (DirectDraw
(Protect driver only), DirectSound) compatible.
FM sound source add-on board SRO-F connector aside, supplied by Melco CD-ROM drive "CDN-4FB"
There is a connector for sound board connection cable connection.However, when SRO-F is attached
Usage prohibited.
When using this board, set the GDC clock of the main unit to 5 MHz and the DMA clock to "high speed".
It is not possible to use this board in combination of PentiumODP (63 MHz) + Windows 95
No (according to the description in the manual 3rd edition published on September 1, 1996).
Both Windows 3.1 and Windows 95 support normal display.

The resource setting is a screen displayed when installing the driver in Windows 3.1.
Also, in Windows 95, "Device manager" is used.
WSN uses the same I / O port address for the window accelerator and the sound unit
In order to select the I / O port address.
A message is displayed but there is no problem.

Operating environment: Temperature 10 to 35 ° C, humidity 20 to 80% (no condensation)
Supported OS: Windows 95, Windows 3.1 enhanced mode (FM sound source is MS-DOS other
　　　　Available in OS)
I / O address: F4xh, 188h-18Fh, A460h, 4xE0h, 5xE0h, 5xE3h, 5xE2h
Interrupt level: Select from INT 0, 1, 2, 5, 4 (IRQ 3, 5, 6, 10) (FM sound source is fixed to INT 5)
FM sound source function: 86 sound source equivalent ... 6 sound stereo, 6 sound stereo rhythm, SSG (3 square waves,
　　　　　　1 noise) (* Optional add-on board, "SRO-F" added)
PCM sound source function: sampling frequency ... 48/44/22/11 / 5.5 kHz
　　　　　　 Resolution: Up to 16bit / 8bit, MONO / STEREO
             Compression format ... Do not compress, ADPCM, A-Law, μ-Law
DMA channel: selected from DMA # 0 or # 3
Occupied memory area: E0000h to E7FFFh (32 KB), F00000 h to F3 FFFFh (256 KB)
MPEG playback: Scenic / MX2
MPEG playback function: MPEG-1 hardware playback (Video / Audio hardware decoding)
Power consumption: WSN-V2 ... + 5 V: max 1000 mA, -12 V: max 5 mA
          WSN-V2M ... + 5 V: max 1700 mA, -12 V: max 5 mA
          WSN-V4 ... + 5 V: max 1100 mA, -12 V: max 5 mA

It is used by model + Windows 3.1 which can carry memory more than 16MB with PC-9801FA or EPSON machine
If you want to install the driver disk 1 before
It is necessary to change OEMSETUP.INF.Driver for floppy drive 1 (example: drive B)
Set the disk backup disk,
A: \> B:
B: \> COPY XXXXXXXX. INF OEMSETUP. INF
However, the part of XXXXXXXX differs depending on the Windows used:
　　NEC version (FD) = OEMNECE
　　MICROSOFT version (FD) = OEMMSE
　　EPSON version (FD) = OEMEPSE
    CD-ROM version = OEMCDE

If you are using the CPU accelerator cache control utility,
Do not cache video memory used by WSN.WSN is F00000h
Use 256 KB of ~ F3 FFFFh as video memory.Melco CPU accelerator
If you are using it, add the following option switch to MELEMM.386 in CONFIG.SYS:
DEVICE = MELEMM. 386 / CX CCR0 = 03 CCR1 = 00 NCR1 = 00F00, 256K ... (These are omitted)
When using the HRX-C12Q,
DEVICE = MELEMM. 386 / BL PM: D0 ... (Omitted below)

When installing the driver on Windows 3.1, you can use
When using the HFA series or EUF series / When using the PC-9801ES,
B: \ SETUP.EXE / E
Enter to start the installer.

When installing the driver on Windows 95, if you purchase MBO-D additionally MBO-D
If you purchased the attached "WSN-V Driver Disk", or WSN-V2 / V2M / V4, SRO-F
Use the "WSN-V Driver Disk" disk included with the WSN-V series.
This product is newer than Windows 95, so the hardware wizard for windows 95
It is not detected automatically.If you purchased SRO-F and MBO-D additionally,
It is necessary to reinstall the driver including sound (PCM).
When using Direct X compatible software, Direct X included with the software
Do not install the driver (WSN will not work properly).

Melco CD-ROM with connector for sound board connection cable connection beside SRO-F connector
Connect the drive "CDN-4E", and it is included in the VIDEO CD (and CD) on Windows 95
When playing back an MPEG file, use the SCSI driver registered with Windows 95.
It is necessary to remove and install the driver for DOS attached to CDS-4E.

When used with PC-586RA, the combination of [44 (or 48) KHz] + [stereo] + [16 bit]
Can not guarantee normal sound quality. When recording at a frequency of 44 (or 48) KHz,
Set the number of channels to [Mono] or set the sample width to [8 bit].
Also, on PC-9801ES, PCM sound source of WSN can not be used.
