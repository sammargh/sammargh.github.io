C bus board type CPU accelerator equipped with V33A-16 MHz (μPD70136AL-16)
("High-speed CPU board").V30 machine (PC-98VM2, VM21, CV, UV)
The operating speed is equivalent to 80286-12 MHz. Equipped with 512KB cache RAM.
It does not work on 80286/80386 machines.Be sure to install this board in the first expansion slot
About. A board with a motor or relay attached to slot 2 or
If a high voltage switching board is installed, remove the board
To do.Use in C bus expansion BOX is not possible.

Clock: Supplied from PC (8/10 MHz)
Writing: Switch switching at 8086 / V30 bus timing 0 to 3 weights
                                                 (4 to 7 clocks)
Reading: RAM area from 00000h to 7FFFFh
　　　　　V33A bus timing 0 wait (2 clocks)
　　　　　RAM area from 80000h to FFFFFh
　　　　　Switch switching at 8086 / V30 bus timing 1 to 3 weights
                                                 (5 to 7 clocks)
Power consumption: 500mA (MAX), 50mA (TYP)
Operating temperature: 10 to 35 ° C

V33A Features:
1) There is no 8080 emulation mode.
2) When an undefined instruction is executed, an INT6 interrupt is generated.
3) When a coprocessor instruction is executed without connecting a coprocessor, an INT7 interrupt is generated.
   Occurrence.
4) V30 starts the POP cycle seven times by POP R instruction, while V33 A performs POP cycle
   Start eight times.

Two 8x dip switches (SW2, SW3), (2x8) + (2x6) jumpers on the surface of the board
Switch (2 switches are juxtaposed, but considered as continuous, 2 x 14 series
Notated as a dip switch: DIC-1), 1 x 2 x 2 series jumper switch (DIC-2)
Yes.Also, on the back of the board, for switching the CPU (V30) of the main unit and the CPU (V33A) on this board
There is one slide switch (SW1).

All compatible models:
・ SW2 ■ ON-OFF-ON-ON-OFF-ON-ON-ON
・ SW3 ■ ON-ON-OFF-ON-OFF-OFF-OFF-OFF-ON

Model dependent:
(1) PC-9801VM2, PC-9801UV2, PC-9801UV21
・ DIC-1 ■ 3, 7, 8, 12 short circuit
・ DIC-2 ■ 1 short

(2) PC-9801VM21
・ DIC-1 ■ 3, 7, 8, 12 short circuit
· DIC-2 · 0 short
※ Set the dip switch 3-6 on the main unit to ON.

(3) PC-9801VM11, PC-9801UV11
・ DIC-1 ■ 2, 6, 7, 14 short
・ DIC-2 ■ 1 short

(4) PC-9801UV2
・ DIC-1 ■ 3, 7, 8, 12 short circuit
・ DIC-2 ■ 1 short

(4) PC-9801CV21
・ DIC-1 ■ 1, 6, 7, 14 short
・ DIC-2 ■ 1 short

If it is possible to execute DISKCOPY normally after installation, it is considered that this board is operating normally.
good.
MS-DOS does not start up correctly, key input can not be done correctly, in the middle of DISK COPY
If a failure such as an error occurs, adjust DIC-1 according to the following procedure:
(1) Replace the jumper plug that shorts any of jumpers 10 to 14 with 13.
    Next, the jumper plug that shorts any of 1 to 5 while 13 is fixed
    Move in order from 1 to 5
    Jumper shorting 13 if it does not operate even if it makes one turn to 1 to 5
    Change the plug to 14, 10, 11, 12 and move the jumper plug from 1 to 5 in order.
(2) If still not working, return the position of 1 to 5 jumper plug to the factory setting,
     Try changing the jumpers that short in order between 10 and 14 in order.
※ Jumpers 6, 7, 8 and 9 are settings in the extreme case, so do not change from the factory settings.
※ The factory setting of DIC-1 is 3, 7, 8 and 12 short and other pins seem to be open.

This board can be used together with a coprocessor because V33A and 8087 can not be connected by hardware.
Not possible (coprocessor not set).
Also, operation at 5MHz clock is not possible. Use at 8 MHz.
