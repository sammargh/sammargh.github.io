PC-9801-29N (NEC)

GP-IB (HP-IB, IEEE-488) board to be inserted into C bus.Maximum power consumption 800 mA. GP-IB controller
Is the μPD7210C equivalent product.This is SH1, AH1, T5 / TE5, L3 / LE3, which are defined in IEEE Std. 
It has all the functions of SR1, RL1, PP1 / PP2, DC1, DT1, C1, C2, C3, C4 and C5, but this board
The following subsets are available.The following is the order of functions, subsets, and functions:
SH SH1 SH all functions
AH ■ AH 1 ■ AH all functions
T ■ T 6 ■ basic talker, serial pole, talker cancellation by MLA
TE ■ TE 0 ■ TE without function
L ■ L 4 ■ Basic listener, listener cancellation by MTA
LE ■ LE 0 ■ LE without function
SR ■ SR 1 ■ All functions
RL ■ RL 1 ■ All functions of RL
PP ■ PP 1 ■ PP function by remote, message
DC DC 1 DC All Functions
DT · DT1 · DT all functions
C1 C1, C2, C3, C4, C26 System controller, IFC transmission, REN transmission, SRQ
　 Response, controller in charge, interface message transmission, parallel
   Pole
It has two modes, master mode and slave mode.In the former, PC-98 is always a system
It is a controller and in the controller in charge state, and the latter is PC-98
It can not be a controller.These modes depend on the status of SW1-5 at system startup.
It is decided.To change the mode, re-initialize after changing SW1-5.

The I / O port addresses used by the board are: 1000001 to 11001111, 10010011, 10011011.
Memory addresses are D4000h to D5FFFh. 8kB mounted with EPROM (High res of PC-98XA, PC-98XL
Not used in mode).

There are 1x10 dip switches and 3 3 jumper switches on the board.

・ 10 stations dip switch SW1: DMA channel, interrupt level, operation mode, my address
　settings of
1-2: DMA channel setting
　ON-ON = DMA 0
  ON-OFF = Setting prohibited
  OFF-ON = Setting prohibited
  OFF-OFF = DMA 3
  Note: The BIOS ROM on this board does not provide software support for the DMA function.
3-4: Interrupt level setting
　ON-ON = INT 0
  ON-OFF = INT 4
  OFF-ON = INT 5 (factory setting)
  OFF-OFF = INT 6
5: Mode setting
　ON = slave
　OFF = master
6-7-8-9-10: Setting my address (talker address / listener address of the main unit)
　Set ON as MSB, 10 as LSB with ON = 1, OFF = 0.However, my address is 31 (decimal: 6-7-8-9
　-10 All OFF) can not be set.

· Triple jumper switch SW2: Whether the ROM on the board is disconnected
　AB short = ROM valid
　Short between BC = ROM invalid

· Triple jumper switches SW3 and SW4: Both should be used in the state of short between AB.

When using this board, it is necessary to turn on the memory switch SW4-5 of the main unit.In this case,
Turn on dip switch SW52-5.However, PC-98XA, PC-98XL (high res mode)
In case of using it, it is necessary to change the setting of memory switch because ROM on the board is not used
None (according to the manual issued in 1987).
The setting of this memory switch is to be referred to by N88-Japanese BASIC (86).
When using Japanese BASIC (86) (MS-DOS version), N88-Japanese BASIC (86) compiler
No need to set memory switch.
