IF-2560 (ICM)

SCSI I / F for the SCSI dedicated slot of PC-9801FA / FS / FX and MATE-A. There are two types of new and old,
The new version called MATE compatible version is written in gray on the bracket (bracket on the back of the board) as M compatible
A round white paper sticker is attached.The boards are both REV. B, but the IC at U6 is
The older version is AMI 9232 LAI 18CV 8 SC-25, while the MATE version is the AMD PALCE 16 V 8 H-15 SC / 4 234 KMLV
Of the 761 (or 7 1) 2560V string is additionally printed on the package (or
It has been changed to PALCE16V8H-15SC / 4 243MRMR with the addition of the character string of 2761 V).
Furthermore, in the MATE compatible version, many jumpers are added on the substrate.ICM is this MATE compatible version
The Windows 95 was officially supported.

The upper limit of recognition capacity of this board using e10chk.exe which is free software created by Mr. Marimo Mr.
As a result, we have obtained the result that there is a wall of 2015 MB for both MATE version and non-MATE version.

There are two 8-deep dip switches and one 4-deep dip switch on the board.
