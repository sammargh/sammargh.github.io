RSA-98III, RSA-98III / S, RSA-98IIISB (I･Oデータ)

PnP compatible C bus high-speed RS-232C expansion board (start-stop synchronization).RSA-98 III (2 channels
On the board, there are two 4 series dip switches (SW1 for Ch1 and SW2 for Ch2).
Corresponding to).In addition, RSA-98III / S, RSA-98IIISB (with 1 channel) has 4 stations
There is one dip switch.
The TL16C550C is adopted for the serial control LSI, and the CPU is about Pentium 133 MHz.
In the case of Windows 95, it is possible to communicate at a transfer rate of up to 921.6 Kbps (in Windows NT 3.5
Up to 230.4 Kbps).The factory setting is RSA mode, but MS-DOS application
Support 16550 compatible mode (equivalent to 2nd CCU of PC-9821 series)
(Maximum 115.2 Kbps).Maximum power consumption +5 V, 200 mA.
The use of multiple pieces of RSA-98III series is not possible in Windows 95 / NT 3.5.Also the old RSA Siri
In addition, it can not be used in combination with (eg, RSA-98, RSA-98II / S).Available in RSA mode
MS-DOS application is BIOS function attached to RSA-98III series
It is only one developed, and in this case it can not be used together with the old RSA series.

・ 4 series dip switches: PnP mode, EEPROM address (INT and I / O port add
　Setting the I / O port address to access the EEPROM that saves the
1: Setting of PnP mode / non-PnP mode
  ON = PnP mode (factory setting)
  OFF = non-PnP mode
  If the computer does not support PnP, multiple RSA-98III series
　When used in 16550 compatibility mode, Windows NT 3.5 with RSA-98III
　Non-PnP mode when using PnP board other than
  Set the same settings for both SW1 and SW2 in RSA-98III.
2: EEPROM address (set by SW3 and SW4) valid / invalid
  ON = Enabled (factory setting)
  OFF = invalid
3-4: EEPROM address value
  ON-ON: 1st port (EEPROM address 0859H: RSA-98III SW1, RSA-98III / S,
　　　　 RSA-98IIISB factory setting)
  ON-OFF: 2nd port (same 0959H: RSA-98III SW2 default setting)
  OFF-ON: 3rd port (same 0A59H)
  OFF-OFF: 4th port (same 0B59H)
  Setting is required when installing multiple RSA-98III series.
　Set SW1 and SW2 of RSA-98III to different EEPROM addresses.

When using in non-PnP mode, the board resource value uses the attached "RSASETUP.EXE"
To set. When used in 16550 compatible mode, INT = 1, I / O port address = 0230H
Set to (Interrupt type = Level).After setting, the setting will not turn off once
It does not become effective.
※ The upper 12 bits of I / O port address can be set between 00DH and FFFH (factory setting 50EH,
51 EH in SW2 of RSA-98III).The lower 4 bits are xx8H ~ for UART control port
xxFH (x is the same for both RSA mode and 16550 mode), xxx0H to xxx7H for various setting ports
(For details, refer to the manual register specifications).
In addition, Windows 3.1, high-speed applications that do not support high-speed serial port
Use the attached software JetCOM to transfer data.

When using RSA-98III in Windows 95 and PnP mode, two INT (IRQ) are used,
The RSA-98III itself works with only one INT.If you want to free INT, the device
After manually shifting the I / O port addresses of the two ports on the manager (for
Change the address of the smaller channel), set INT to the same value (larger COM number
Set the INT of the other channel to the INT of the smaller channel).COM number large
In the channel of the other!A mark is attached but the operation is normal.When set to non-PnP mode,
Since Ch1 and Ch2's INT has the same value, change it to Ch2!Mark is attached, but the board with other boards
There is no problem in operation as long as there is no source conflict or I / O port address conflict with Ch1 and Ch2.
