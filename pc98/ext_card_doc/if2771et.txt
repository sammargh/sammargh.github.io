IF-2771ET (ICM)

Non-PnP, multi-vendor non-compliant bus master SCSI I / F and 10BASE-T NIC
Composite C bus board with.10BASE-T on the second bus connector of IF-2771
It is not an addition of a module, but a completely different one.disk
The parameters are 55 compatible. It seems that the operation has been confirmed on HDDs up to 4.3 GB.
Also, it seems that it can be used even on machines with MMX Pentium.
I examined using e10chk.exe which is free software created by Mr. Marimo
The maximum recognition capacity of this board with BIOS ROM 1.02 was 2015 MB.
The setting of the SCSI unit is performed by switches on the board, and the setting of the NIC unit is attached
It does in SETUP.EXE in \ UTILITY of utility FD of.SETUP.EXE
Running on MS-DOS.
Two 8-deep dip switches and one 4-deep dip switch on the board,
1x3 2x2 Jumper Switch, 1x 3x4 Jumper Switch, 2x Jumper
There are 2 switches and 3 jumper switches.
※ Is the description of switch setting in this table after ICM bankruptcy?This board is a PC
　It is thought that it was attached when it was knocked out as a bulk product in the workshop
　One piece of blurred copy material (made by cutting and pasting the diagram of the manual
　Seems to be: additional copies of attachments? )It is based on.Therefore
　It is unknown about the factory setting of the switch, but it may be the same as IF-2771.
　unknown.See also the setting table of IF-2771.

・ 8-station dip switch SW2: Local memory address of SCSI ROM, body model,
　SCSI BIOS ROM enable / disable setting
1-2-3-4-5-6-7: SCSI ROM local memory address and machine type setting
　PC-98 XA xxx-OFF-ON-OFF-OFF ■ \ EC 000 h ~ \ ECFFF h
　Normal / high res dual-purpose machine ■ OFF-ON-ON-OFF-ON-OFF-ON
　　　　　　　　　　　　　■ Normal mode \ DC 000 h ~ \ DCF FF h
　　　/ During high res mode \ EC 000 h ~ \ ECFFF h
　Other than the above ■ OFF-ON-ON-xx-ON-ON ■ \ DC 000 h ~ \ DC F FF h
　※ x can be ON or OFF.Also, \ is 0h or Fh.
8: SCSI BIOS ROM enable / disable setting
　ON ■ effective
　OFF ■ Invalid
※ 8 is set together with SW3.
　
・ 4 stations dip switch SW3: I / O port address, transfer mode setting
1-2: I / O port address setting
　ON-ON CCxh
　OFF-ON CDxh
　ON-OFF CExh
　OFF-OFF CFxh
　※ x is 0, 2, 4 in DMA / bus master mode, and in FIFO mode
　　Represents 0, 2, 4, 6
3-4: Transfer mode setting
　OFF-ON ■ Synchronous bus master transfer
　ON-OFF W-FIFO transfer
　OFF-OFF DMA transfer

・ 3x2 jumper switch JP7: Enable / Disable setting of SCSI and NIC
　2-3, 4-5 short ■ SCSI enabled, NIC enabled
　2-3, 5-6 short ■ SCSI enabled, NIC disabled
　1-2, 4-5 short ■ SCSI disabled, NIC enabled
　1-2 5-6 short ■ SCSI invalid, NIC invalid
　※ Please set according to SW2-8.

・ 3-pin × 4-unit jumper switch JP10: 10-BASE-T signal line forward / reverse inversion setting
(Crossover switch)
　Short between 1-2 ■ Cross
　Short between 2-3 ■ straight
※ For changing LAN cable straight <-> cross (reverse) connection (one of them
　It seems to be able to use one kind of cable in two ways).
※ A jumper plug with one 2x4 jumper plug is inserted.

・ 2 jumper switch JP3: Not described in the document (opened by hand)
・ 2 jumper switch JP4: Not described in the document (opened by hand)
・ 3-pin jumper switch JP5: Not described in the document (2-3 shorts with hand-held type)
・ 3-pin jumper switch JP6: Not described in the document (2-3 shorts with hand-held type)
* These four jumper switches may be the same as IF-2771.
