CARD240, CARD350 (R & D)

C bus on board HDD. The CARD 240 has a capacity of 251.9 MB, and the CARD 350 has a 362.8 MB.
The mounted HDD is a special product, so replacement with a general drive is not possible.
There is no external terminal.High res mode not supported.
SASI / SCSI / IDE in PC to emulate SASI or SCSI
Can coexist even if any HDD is connected (SCSI HDD connected to the main unit
SASI compatible mode, SASI / IDE HDD is connected if it is
In case of use in SCSI compatible mode).Also with the SCSI-PLUS function
Additional connection is possible even if both SCSI and SASI HDDs are connected.

※ About SCSI-PLUS function
By using the SCSI-PLUS function, this machine in SCSI compatible mode can be used with other SCSI HDDs.
Can coexist withHowever, this function is PC-9801-55 and complete
Only when using a compatible SCSI board.
→ In the normal mode, the ROM address in the SCSI mode is from DE000h to DEFFFh
/ DF000h to DEFFFh, and in high resolution mode, ROM address in SCSI mode
Setting to between EF000h and EFFFFh automatically enables the SCSI-PLUS function.
Note: As mentioned above, the beginning of the manual says that the high res mode is not supported.
