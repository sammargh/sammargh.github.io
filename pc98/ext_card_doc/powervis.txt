Power Vision (Canopus)

Composite C bus board with video capture and PCM sound.8 stations dip switch on the board
There are two, four jumper switches and one variable resistor.

【Video input section】
Input signal: NTSC composite signal, S (Y / C separation) signal
Number of bits per pixel: RGB 5: 5: 5
I / O port address: xxD0h (default can be changed by 28D0h to 28DFh, DS3)
Interrupt level: INT2 (can be changed by driver software)
Capture size: 80x60, 160x120, 320x240, 640x480 (according to the manual issued in September 1993)
[Voice output unit]
Input / output signals: input MIC-IN, LINE-IN / output LINE-OUT
Sampling frequency: 44.1, 22.05, 11.025 kHz
I / O port address: xx 18 h (Default can be changed by 4718 h to 471 Fh, DS4)
Interrupt level: INT1 (can be changed by driver software)
【Operating environment】
Maximum current consumption: +5 V = 300 mA, +12 V = 250 mA, -12 V = 10 mA
Operating temperature: 10 to 35 ° C
Operating humidity: 20 to 80% (without condensation)

・ 8-station dip switch SW3: I / O port setting for video input
Specify the upper 2 digits of the video input I / O port (the lower 2 digits are fixed to D0).For each dip
In contrast, 8-7-6-5-4-3-2-1 is the upper two digits of the I / O port address when ON = 0 and OFF = 1.
Supports binary number display.
Example: ON-ON-OFF-ON-OFF-ON-ON-ON = 00101000 (binary) = 28 (hexadecimal)-> 28D0h (hexadecimal)

・ 8 stations dip switch SW4: I / O port setting for voice input / output
Specify the upper two digits of the voice input / output I / O port (the lower two digits are fixed at 18).Also, the lower two of the upper two digits
Since the 3 bits are fixed to 1 (when using the audio output function), the base address is x718h or xF18h
Configurable.Dip switch 1 is used to set the use / disengagement of the audio output function, and used with ON,
Disconnect with OFF.
When the voice output function is used, it is assumed that ON = 0 and OFF = 1 for each dip.
8-7-6-5-4-3-2-1 supports I / O port address upper 2 digits binary number display.
Example: ON-OFF-ON-ON-ON-OFF-OFF-ON = 01010010 (binary) = 47 (hexadecimal)-> 4718h (advanced)

Jumper switch SW1: NTSC signal switching
Normally ON side short.NES, still camera, video deck pause signal
Etc. are not formal NTSC signals, and they must be ON-side shorted when capturing them
Normal import impossible.It is a formal NTSC signal, and the vertical and horizontal dimensions of the captured image are severely shaken.
OFF side short circuit only.

・ Jumper switch JP2, JP3: Output attenuation
The factory settings are both open.The sound is loud when connecting stereo headphones to the OUT terminal
If it is too short, both will be short.

Jumper switch 4: Jumper for capacitor microphone
The factory setting is open.Bias voltage when connecting a condenser microphone to the MIC-IN terminal
Short if necessary.

Volume VR2: for adjusting color subcarrier frequency.Never touch it.

・ Volume MIC-VR (on the panel of the board): Microphone level adjustment
Microphone sound level adjustment.Turning it clockwise makes the sound louder, turning it counterclockwise makes it smaller.
Use when the adjustment of the volume can not be completed with the supplied software.
