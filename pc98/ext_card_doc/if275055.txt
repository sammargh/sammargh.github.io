IF-2750, IF-2755 (ICM)

A multi-vendor non-compliant C bus SCSI I / F. Windows 95 compatible.SCSI connector
Is the ICM's proprietary D sub 37 pin.ICM D-sub 37-pin male-amphenol
When using a half-male SCSI cable "HD-4020-03", this I / F
Amphenol half 50 pin SCSI device can be used
D-sub 37-pin male-amphenol full-pitch 50-pin male, D-sub
The presence of a 37-pin male-D-sub 25-pin male SCSI cable has been confirmed).
If the HDD used in PC-9801-55 is connected, it can be recognized as it is.
Some models have limitations on the expansion slots that can be installed:
　PC-9801E ... # 1 to # 5
　PC-9801F ... # 1 to # 3
　PC-9801U ... # 1
　PC-9801 VF2 ... # 1 to # 3
　PC-9801UV ・ ・ ・ # 1
　PC-98 XA ... # 4
Power consumption: Non-access = 410mA (standard) / Access = 450mA (maximum)
There are two 8-deep dip switches and one 4-deep dip switch on the board.

· 8 stations dip switch SW1: SCSI ID number of this board, interrupt level,
　DMA channel setting
1-2-3: SCSI ID number setting
　OFF-OFF-OFF 0
　ON-OFF-OFF 1
　OFF-ON-OFF 2
　ON-ON-OFF 3
　OFF-OFF-ON 4
　ON-OFF-ON 5
　OFF-ON-ON 6
　ON-ON-ON 7 (default setting)
4-5-6: Setting interrupt level
　OFF-OFF-OFF INT 0 (factory setting)
　ON-OFF-OFF INT 1
　OFF-ON-OFF INT 2
　ON-ON-OFF INT 3
　OFF-OFF-ON INT 5
　ON-OFF-ON INT 6
　* Normally set INT 0/1/5.
7-8: DMA channel setting
　OFF-OFF # 0 (default setting)
　ON-OFF ■ Setting prohibited
　OFF-ON # 2
　ON-ON # 3
※ DMA is not used at data transfer in FIFO mode, but status is
　Use DMA when executing commands such as.

・ 8 stations dip switch SW2: local memory address (1-2-3-4-5),
　Main unit model setting (6-7)
(8 is always ON. Default setting: OFF-ON-ON-OFF-ON-ON-OFF-ON)
The following shows the main unit model ■ DIP switch settings ■ Memory address order:
　8086 mounting machine ■ OFF-ON-OFF-xx-ON-OFF-ON ■ D4000h ~ D4FFFh
　V30 machine ■ OFF-ON-ON-xx-ON-OFF-ON ■ DC000h ~ DCFFFh
　PC-98 XA xxx-OFF-ON-OFF-OFF-ON ■ \ EC 000 h ~ \ ECFFF h
　Normal / Hi-Res dual-purpose machine ■ OFF-ON-ON-OFF-ON-OFF-OFF-ON-ON
　　　■ Normal mode \ DC 000 h ~ \ DCF FF h
　　　/ During high res mode \ EC 000 h ~ \ ECFFF h
　Other than the above ■ OFF-ON-ON-xx-ON-ON-ON ■ \ DC 000 h ~ \ DC F FF h
　※ x can be ON or OFF.Also, \ is 0h or Fh.
　※ When used in combination with B4670II (PC-9864L), regardless of the main unit model, 4-5 of SW2
　　Make it ON-ON.In this case the local memory address is
　　It is set to \ EE000h ~ \ EEFFFh.
　※ In PC-9801U2 and V30 loading machine, switch pin on the side of card edge back and forth
　　Reverse direction.

・ 4 stations dip switch SW3: I / O port address, transfer mode setting
1-2: I / O port address setting
　ON-ON CCxh (default setting)
　OFF-ON CDxh
　ON-OFF CExh
　OFF-OFF CFxh
　* X represents 0, 2, 4 in DMA mode and 0, 2, 4, 6 in FIFO mode.
　※ Access from DISK BIOS is not available if it is set other than factory setting
　　become unable.Use special hardware such as PC-98B55
　　If only change it.
3: Transfer mode setting
　ON FIFO transfer (default setting)
　OFF DMA transfer
　※ FIFO transfer is not possible on machines with the 8086.
4: Not used (always on)

ICM does not guarantee the use of HDD via I / O expansion unit.
