EIF-98FB (ELECOM)

SCSI I / F in the PC-9801FA / FS / FX, MATE-A SCSI dedicated slot With PC-98FA-02
Hardware compatible.EMS board and this board when using the sound board
Do not mix with.When using the EMS driver, book the page frame of EMS
Set so as not to overlap with the board's ROM address.
The final ROM seems to be 2.30, but it does not support HDD of 1GB or more, and the version of ROM is upgraded
It is also impossible to make it correspond.In addition, ELECOM made this board non-compliant with Windows 95.
There are 2 8 dip switches and 3 3 jumper switches on the board.

　OFF-OFF-ON INT 5
　ON-OFF-ON INT 6
7-8: DMA channel setting
　OFF-OFF DMA 0
　ON-ON DMA 3 (default setting)

・ 8 stations dip switch SW2: ROM address setting
1-2-3: ROM address setting
　OFF-OFF-OFF ■ D0000h to D0FFFh
　ON-OFF-OFF D2000h to D2FFFh

　ON-ON-ON ■ DE000h to DEFFFh
4-5-6-7-8: Always OFF-ON-ON-ON-ON

・ Three jumper switches SW3 and SW4: I / O page address setting
　In the following, the order of SW3 SW4 I / O page address:
　1-2 short ■ 1-2 short ■ CC0h (factory setting)
　2-3 short ■ 1-2 short ■ CD0h
　1-2 short ■ 2-3 short ■ CE0h
　2-3 short ■ 2-3 short ■ CF0h

・ Three jumper switch SW8: Transfer mode setting
　1-2 short ■ DMA transfer
　2-3 short ■ DMA / FIFO automatic switching (DMA transfer in OS / 2, FIFO in other OS)
                                 Transfer: Factory setting)

■ Quick boot function
The quick boot function is the check of the number after the ID number set on this board
Function that omits.This can reduce the time until system startup.
When setting the ID number of the maximum value + 1 of the ID number of the connected SCSI device and turning on the PC,
The quick boot function works.This function is only available on MS-DOS (OS / 2 etc.
Let's use it with ID = 7).

■ Quick format function
The quick formatting function executes MS-DOS initialization and area allocation at high speed.
function.
When the format screen is displayed by the FORMAT / H command of MS-DOS, press the [Kana] key,
After that, proceed with initialization-> area reservation.
