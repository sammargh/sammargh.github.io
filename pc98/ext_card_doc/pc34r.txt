PC34R-1M, PC34R-2M, PC34R-4M, PC34R-8M,
PC34R-12M, PC34R-16M, PC34R-32M (I • O data)

Bankram, hardware EMS, C bus RAM board compatible with protected memory.
Make various settings with the software called MEMORY SERVER II (Note).

Note: The description in this document refers to the operation of PC34R-4M bundled with MEMORY SERVER II.
It is based.Setting of PC34R series can not be performed with MEMORY SERVER II
Information [The choice of the board includes the PC34R series, but trying to set it
Even if (without II) MEMORY SERVER or hardware setup
The disc is thrown as needed.MEMORY SERVER II is included
The thing also came with the PC34R setup disk

One rotary switch and one double dip switch on the board,
Connector (Note 1) for external battery unit (BU-8), expansion option
There is a connector (Note 2) for the board (RAM daughter board).
Note 1: This board is in I / O bank memory mode and hardware expanded EMS
　　External battery when used as a RAM disk in memory mode
　　Device BU-8 can be used as a nonvolatile RAM disk (data
　　Retention time: 1-9 days).RAM disk startup is not possible.
Note 2: For boards other than PC34R-32M, EX34F-2M (2MB), EX34F-4M (4M),
　　 Additional expansion is possible with EX34F-8M (8MB) and EX34R-16M (16MB).

・ Rotary switch: Board number setting (factory setting = 0)
　0 1st sheet 1 2nd sheet 2 3rd sheet 3 4th sheet
　4th 5th 5th 6th 6th 7th 7th 8th
　8th 9th 9th 10th A 11th B B 12th
　C13 13th D 14th E 15th F 16th
　When using multiple PC34Rs, be sure to set the first sheet to "0".

-Dual dip switch (INIT switch): Normally used with OFF-OFF.
　When adding additional option boards, add the option board
　This board is added to the PC main body with the additional expansion added and the INIT switch set to ON-OFF.
　Attach to and reset to OFF-OFF after power ON.Then MEMORY SERVER II
　Make settings using the hardware setup disk.
※ Function of each dip
　1 (INV): Ignore the setting of PC34R and leave nothing set.
　　　　　 Turn it on and reset it or turn it on again.
　2 (RST): Used when an external battery device is connected.Normally turned off
　　　　　 about.The main unit stopped working after a system runaway or a power failure
　　　　　 In case of operation.Either the BU-8 is connected or the power of the unit is turned on.
　　　　　 Turn it on in the off state and turn it back off again.

HiSUM function of PC34R when used with SDB series silicon disks
Turn off.
Sound when used as hardware EMS or protected memory
Need to disconnect BIOS ROM.
When used in conjunction with the PIO-9034 / 9134 series, special ones tailored to the memory configuration
Setting is required.Please contact I / O data support center before PC34R implementation.
