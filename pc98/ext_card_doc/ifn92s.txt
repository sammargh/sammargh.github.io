・ 2 jumper switch JP4: SCSI bus signal "TERMPWR", normally open
Used in (factory setting) (power supply to active terminator on board
  Would be a setting jumper)
※ Normally, use the same jumper settings for each jumper switch.

For interrupt level, DMA channel, transfer method, etc., select [CTRL] + [GRAPH] + [S].
SCSI board activated by power ON or reset switch ON while holding down
Set by the setting utility.
Transfer method is using PC-9801T and CPU accelerator + internal expansion memory together
Select I / O transfer mode for PC-9801 RX.
In addition, bus master transfer is supported on the main unit with 16 MB or more of protect memory attached.
Usage prohibited.
