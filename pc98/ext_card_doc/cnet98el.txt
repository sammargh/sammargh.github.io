C bus 10-BASE 5/2 / T NIC. Board resources are included software
Set by.Three jumper switches and 2 × 3 series dips on the board
There is one switch (the latter is C-NET (98) E series only).

I / O port address: 32 bytes occupied
　n3D0h to n3DFh, n7D0h to n7DFh (n = 0 to F) (set by software)
　AAEDh, AAEFh or 55EDh, 55EFh (set in JP1)
Interrupt level
　INT 0, 1, or 2 (one set by software)
power consumption
　10BASE 5 = +5 V, 300 mA
　10BASE 2 = +5 V, 500 mA
　10BASE T = +5 V, 300 mA
Operating temperature range
　0 to 50 ° C

・ Three jumper switch JP1: Fixed I / O port address setting
　Two shorts on the AAEDH ■ AAEDh (factory setting)
　Two 55EDH-side shorts 55EDh
※ Usually, use with the factory setting.Novell NetWare J server
　This setting when using two C-NET (98) E / L series at the same time
　 Do not overlap.
・ 2 x 3 dip switch JP2: Designation of the type of LAN connector to be used
　AUI short ■ 10BASE-5
　BNC short ■ 10BASE-2
　UTP short 10BASE-T
Factory setting: C-NET (98) E = BNC short (only BNC and AUI jumpers are equipped)
　　　　　　C-NET (98) E-11 = BNC
　　　　　　C-NET (98) E-12 = UTP (with only UTP and AUI jumpers)
