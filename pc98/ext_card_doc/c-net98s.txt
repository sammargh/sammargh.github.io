C-NET (98) S-11, C-NET (98) S-12 (CONTEC)

C bus bus master NIC (LAN board) equipped with 10BASE-2 / 5/10 connector.
C-NET (98) S-12 with 3 jumper switches on the board,
There are two in C-NET (98) S-11.
power consumption
　10BASE-5: +5 V = 320 mA, +12 V = 500 mA
　10BASE-2: +5 V = 490 mA
　10BASE-T: +5 V = 310 mA
Operating temperature range: 0 to 50 °, operating humidity range: 20 to 80% (no condensation)

・ Three jumper switch JP1: Use of interrupt and external bus master
　/ Release settings
　2 shorts on INIT side ■ Release interrupt and external bus master
　NORMAL side 2 shorts ■ Use interrupt and external bus master
　　　　　　　　　　 (Factory setting)
Normally used with 2 shorts on NORMAL side.Because this board was attached
If the system does not start up, short two INITs,
Set values from [Board Settings] in the self-diagnosis program (DIAG)
Change.After the change, be sure to reset the NORMAL side to 2 shorts.

・ Setting of switching of 3 jumper switches JP2: 10BASE-2 / 5
(Only present in C-NET (98) S-11)
Set whether to use 10BASE-2 / 5 switching automatically or fixedly.
When 10BASE-T is used, 10BASE-T takes precedence,
The settings on this switch are invalid.
　Automatic switching of 2 AUTO side short ■ 10BASE-2 / 5 (default setting)
　Two AUI side short ■ Fixed 10BASE-5
Normally, use with AUTO.

※ I / O port address, interrupt level, external bus master is software
　Set in the ware.
I / O port address
　n3D0h to n3DFh, n7D0h to n7DFh 32 bytes occupied (n = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　/ Factory setting: n = 0)
Interrupt level
　Select one from INT 0, 1, 2, 3 (Factory setting: INT 1)
External bus master
　One of EXHRQ 1 and 2 (Factory setting: EXHRQ)
