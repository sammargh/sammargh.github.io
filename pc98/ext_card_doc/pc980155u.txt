PC-9801-55U (NEC)

C bus SCSI I / F. SCSI connector is Amphenol half 50 pin.
When connecting an HDD for NEC check of ROM, the first vendor name
If the three letters do not begin with NEC (NEC, NECTSU, NECTOR, etc.),
Beeps continuously and does not start the body by entering an infinite loop.
When connecting a cassette magnetic tape unit, I / O with other SCSI devices
To separate F (two boards required).
There are 2 8 dip switches and 2 3 jumper switches on the board.

· 8 stations dip switch SW1: SCSI ID number of the board, interrupt level,

(5) The machine with an 80286/386/486 (only for normal mode)
　OFF-ON-ON-xx-ON-ON ■ Memory address \ DC 000 h ~ \ DDFFF h
※ x can be set to ON or OFF, and \ means 0h or Fh.
※ When used with B4670 II (PC-9864L / PC-9864U) in high resolution mode,
　OFF-ON-ON-ON-ON-OFF-OFF (PC-98XA) or OFF-ON-ON-ON-ON-ON-OFF-ON
(Normal / high res combined use machine)
※ The combination with GP-IB interface board is not possible with the 8086 installed machine.
8: Setting of ROM accessibility at Pow on
　ON ■ ROM accessible (factory setting)
　OFF ■ ROM can not be accessed

・ Three jumper switches SW3 and SW4: I / O port address setting
Below, short pin at SW3 ■ Short pin at SW4 ■ I / O port address
Order of:
　01-02 ■ 01 02 ■ CC0h, CC2h, CC4h (factory setting)
　02-03 ■ 01 02 ■ CD0h, CD2h, CD4h
　01-02 ■ 02 03 ■ CE0h, CE2h, CE4h
　02-03 ■ 02 03 ■ CF 0 h, CF 2 h, CF 4 h
※ Except when the cassette magnetic tape unit is connected, use with the factory setting.
　Also, when changing to settings other than the factory settings, turn off SW2-8.

When used on an 8086 / V30 machine, the switch beside the card edge connector
Make the pin lever point up.
