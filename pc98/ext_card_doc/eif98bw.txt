  ON-OFF-OFF: ID = 1
  OFF-ON-OFF: ID = 2
  ON-ON-OFF: ID = 3
  OFF-OFF-ON: ID = 4
  ON-OFF-ON: ID = 5
  OFF-ON-ON: ID = 6
  ON-ON-ON: ID = 7 (factory setting)
4-5-6: Setting interrupt level
  OFF-OFF-OFF: INT 0 (factory setting)
  ON-OFF-OFF: INT 1
  OFF-ON-OFF: INT 2
  ON-ON-OFF: INT 3
  OFF-OFF-ON: INT 5
  ON-OFF-ON: INT 6
7-8: DMA channel
  OFF-OFF: DMA 0
  OFF-ON: DMA 2 (available only for PC-9801E / F / U / UF / XA)

  ON-ON-OFF: D6000h to D6FFFh
  OFF-OFF-ON: D 8000 h to D 8 FFF h
  ON-OFF-ON: DA000h to DAFFFh
  OFF-ON-ON: DC000h to DCFFFh (factory setting)
  ON-ON-ON: DE000 to DEFFFh
  ※ Due to the ROM address, simultaneous use of this board, EMS and sound functions is not possible.
  　Also, when using with PC-9801 E / F / M, set D4000h to D4FFFh.
4-5: Setting ROM address in high resolution mode
  OFF-OFF: XE8000h to XE8FFFh
  ON-OFF: XEA000h to XEAFFFh
  OFF-ON: XEC000h to XECFFFh (factory setting)
  ON-ON: XEE000h to XEEFFFh
  * "X" stands for "0H" or "FH".
6-7: Setting of machine model
  ON-OFF: CPU is the model of 8086 or V30
  ON-ON: Model with only 286 CPUs in normal mode only (default setting)
  OFF-OFF: PC-98XA (high res dedicated model)
  OFF-ON: Model with both normal mode and high resolution mode, high resolution board
          Installed model
8: Enable / Disable of SCSI_BIOS
  ON: SCSI_BIOS enabled (factory setting)
  OFF: SCSI_BIOS disabled

・ 4 series jumper switch JB1: Setting of hold request channel
  HRQ1, HLA1 = short, HRQ2, HLA2 = open: HRQ / HLA channel 1
  HRQ1, HLA1 = open, HRQ2, HLA2 = short: HRQ / HLA channel 2 (factory setting)

· Triple jumper switch JB3: Transfer method, I / O page address setting
TM0D: Transfer method setting
  Open: Automatically switch DMA / bus master transfer depending on CPU type (factory setting)
  Short: Forced DMA transfer
　　※ It is used in advanced mode with Epson PC (when used in normal mode
　　　DMA transfer).When using OS / 2, bus master mode is canceled automatically.
IOA0-IOA1: I / O page address setting
  Short-short: CC0H
