Need to supply +12 V by dedicated power supply PC-9801-77-01U in 10BASE-2 configuration
Yes.In PC-98 other than this, multiple mounting of this board using 10BASE-2
And dedicated boards are needed if other boards are using +12 V
It becomes.The PC-H98 and SV-H98 do not require a dedicated power supply in the 10BASE-2 configuration.Also
When using 10BASE-5, dedicated power is supplied to any of the PC-98, PC-H98 and SV-H98.
