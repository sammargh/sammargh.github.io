PC98M33SII (Caravelle)

Multi-vendor non-compliant C bus bus master SCSI-2 board.Not compatible with Win95.
Three 8 dip switches on the board, 4 jumper switches, 2 runs
There is one paswitches each.

・ 8-station dip switch SW1: SCSI_ID, interrupt level, DMA channel setting
1-2-3: SCSI_ID
　ON-ON-ON: ID = 7 (factory setting)
4-5-6: Interrupt level
　OFF-OFF-OFF: INT0 (IRQ3)
　ON-OFF-OFF: INT1 (IRQ5)
　OFF-ON-OFF: INT2 (IRQ6)
　ON-ON-OFF: INT3 (IRQ9)
　OFF-OFF-ON: INT5 (IRQ12)
　ON-OFF-ON: INT6 (IRQ13)
7-8: DMA channel
　OFF-OFF: DMA0
　ON-ON: DMA3

・ 8-station dip switch SW2: Local memory address, specification of main unit model
1-2-3: Local memory address in normal mode
　OFF-ON-ON: \ DC000- \ DCFFF
4-5: Local memory address in high resolution mode
　OFF-ON: \ EC000- \ ECFFF
※ In model supporting both normal mode, high res mode
　1-2-3-4-5 All settings.
※ OFF-ON-OFF-OFF-ON for PC-286L, LE, LF (use of extended I / O box), LP
　Set to.
6-7: Main unit model
　ON-ON: Model in normal mode that supports protected mode
　ON-OFF: PC-9801VF, VM, UF, UR, UV, CV, N, NV (N, NV are expanded I / O boxes
　　　　　, PC-286U (does not support protected mode)
　　　　　Model)
　OFF-ON: PC-98XL, XL ^ 2, RL, PC-H98 (Normal mode and high res
　　　　　Models that support both modes)
　OFF-OFF: PC-98XA (model only in high res mode)　
8: Always on

・ 8-station dip switch SW3: I / O address, setting of forced DMA mode
1-2: I / O address
　ON-ON: CC0, CC2, CC4
　OFF-ON: CD0, CD2, CD4
　ON-OFF: CE0, CE2, CE4
　OFF-OFF: CF0, CF2, CF4
3-4: Always on
5: Forced DMA mode
　ON: Bus master transfer mode (factory setting, usually do not change)
　OFF: Forced DMA mode
※ We set bus master transfer mode in model equipped with CPU before 80286
　Even if you do, it will be DMA transfer.
6-7-8: Always OFF-ON-OFF

・ 4 series jumper switch JP1: Setting of hold request channel
　1-8, 3-6 short, 2-7, 4-5 open: hold request
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Channel 1 (factory setting)
　1-8, 3-6 open, 2-7, 4-5 short: hold request
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Channel 2

・ Double jumper switch JP2: Do not change
　1-4 short, 2-3 open

※ This board and EMS additional RAM board, FM sound board
　Simultaneous use is not possible.In addition, the start address of the expanded RAM board EMS
　Is set to \ C0000.
