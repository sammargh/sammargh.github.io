MPG-98 (I･Oデータ)

C bus full color full motion MPEG-1 playback board for second bus.
Output display to TV with video terminal and S terminal is possible.

デ フ ォ ル ト MPG-98 default settings
・ Short pin (interruption: JP1)
　Second from the mark: INT1 (IRQ5)
・ I / O port setting (arrow is ON direction is up)
SW1: ↓ ↑ ↑ ↑ ↑
　　　　1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 (D0H)
SW2: ↑ ↓ ↓ ↑ ↑
　　　　1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 (75 H)
And it becomes 75D0H.

It is postscript, but it worked on Win98, but because it does not have the overlay function
Not very useful. (I can do it via GV-98, but consume one C bus)
