EIF-98AW (ELECOM)

Multi-vendor compatible C bus bus master SCSI-2 board.
The setting method basically conforms to EIF-98AW III (see 98 JUNK. DOC).
There is no Win95 driver. Inf file seems to exist, but eventually 55 drivers
As it will be used, it may be used for DMA transfer.However, ELECOM is official
The board is not compatible with Windows 95, and the upgrade to EIF-98AW III is required for operation.
I needed it.

The final ROM is 2.01 for EIF-98AW and 2.11 for EIF-98AWII and EIF-98AWIII.ELECOM
These boards are compatible with HDDs of 1GB or more because the expression on the old web page is vague
It is unclear whether or not (other boards do not support, ROM version up
Although "None" is written in the remarks column of the correspondence table in which the propriety is described, it is as it is
Does that mean it corresponds?).
