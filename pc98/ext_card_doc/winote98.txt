A cable is necessary. (For models prior to NS / A, a CRT pack is attached when the WINnote 98 is attached.
A special CRT pack is included).
The resume function is not supported.In addition, FM sound source is installed in the body such as PC-486NOTE
Do not use the FM sound generator of the main unit with the model.
Supported OS: MS-DOS 3.3 or higher, MS-Windows 3.1 (Microsoft version, NEC version, Epson version).
It seems that it can not be used on Windows 95.In addition, the main unit with more than 14.6MB of memory
It seems that accelerators can not be used.
※ There is a possibility that a problem may occur when installing WINnote 98 because of insufficient power supply capacity in NS / A.
　When Qvision still exists, it is free within 3 months after purchasing WINnote 98
　The main body was being remodeled at.

● Graphic accelerator
It is equipped with CL-GD5428 (image memory 1MB) manufactured by Cirrus Logic.I / O address = 4xES, 5xES, 
46E8 (x = 0 to F, S = 0, 2, 4, 6, A, C, E).
640 x 400, 640 x 480, in combination with an external multi-scan display
Display at 800 x 600, 1024 x 768, 1280 x 1024 dots resolution possible.
Even when using play, it is possible to display 16.77 million colors with 640 × 400 dots (all are Windows 3.1
while using it).

Wide screen function allows you to use Windows screen widely even on small displays
Possible (for example, using a 1280 x 1024 dot screen with a 640 x 400 dot normal display).
Whether to use this function is specified when installing the driver.
● FM sound source
Equipped with YMF264 (completely compatible with PC-9801-26K).3 FM sound sources (monaural), 3 SSG sound sources (monaural).
Equipped with joystick port.
● PCM sound source
Equipped with CS4231.Sampling frequency 5.5-48.0 kHz.Interrupt (INT) level (0 to 3),
DMA channel (0, 3) is specified when installing the driver.
● SCSI I / F
55 compatible, equipped with multi-vendor function.There are two transfer methods: DMA transfer and I / O string transfer.
DMA channel = CH 0, interrupt level = INT

For hardware settings, hold down [CTRL] + [GRPH] + [S] simultaneously and turn on the power switch
Use the "Switch setting menu" screen that is displayed by pressing the / reset button.
<SCSI Related>
1 Transfer method
・ I / O transfer ... Corresponds to 80286 CPU or more.This mode is usually faster than DMA transfer
　Used in.
DMA transfer: Some devices and software operate only in this mode.
23.5 inches MO mode
・ MO mode: Normal MO drive mode.
-HD mode: A mode that recognizes the MO drive as a hard disk.This mode
　Will lock the inserted media.
・ Automatic discrimination ... Check the contents of the format of the MO media inserted when the main unit was started
　This mode automatically determines whether it is MO mode or HD mode.Normally used in this mode
　About.
3 check ID
　Search for SCSI_ID only up to the specified ID number.Reduced system startup time
　Valid for
4 quick format
　When it is ON, formatting of the hard disk of specified ID can be done at high speed.
5 connection check time
　Set connection check time of SCSI device.Because the boot time differs depending on the SCSI device,
　Specify the time to be recognized normally.Usually specify "normal".
<Multimedia relationship>
6 base I / O address
　I / O address used by WINnote 98. 4xE0, 4xE2, 4xE4, 4xE6, 4xEA, 4xEC, 4xEE
　Choose from.The factory setting is 4xE0.

Start of automatic parameter analysis program:
When the display shows "WINnote98 BIOS REV 1.00 ...." after turning on the power of the main unit, [CTRL] + [GRPH] + [P]
At the same time, "HD parameter automatic analysis program" is started.I want to analyze
Specify SCSI_ID of hard disk.When analysis is completed normally, press the [ESC] key, and
Is that okay? "Select "Yes" in response to the message on
Register format information.When the hard disk to be connected is changed or connected
You need to do this also if you change the hard disk SCSI_ID.However, they are connected
You do not need to do this if you remove the hard disk and use it.
If automatic analysis of parameters fails, use "HDPARA.EXE" in the attached disk.
To analyze:
Start the hard disk to be analyzed in the original environment, and from the attached disk HDPARA.EXE
Start up, and display the “HD parameter display program” parameter (number of cylinders,
Write the number of headers and the number of sectors).Then connect the hard disk to WINnote 98,
Start the "HD parameter automatic analysis program", select SCSI_ID and press the [HELP] key.
Enter the correction mode, enter the previously written parameters, and then press the [f • 1] key.
Register the meter.
