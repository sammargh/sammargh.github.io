Composite interface BOX mounted on 110-pin expansion bus of PC-486NOTE AS. graphic
Equipped with accelerator, PCM sound source and CD-ROM interface.PC expansion bus
Remove the cover and attach it.
Power consumption 1.75 W. Because the power consumption at the expansion connector will exceed the allowable power consumption of the main unit,
Adapter to connect MMP-98N to other expansion connectors (with through output of expansion connector
SCSI_I / F etc.) Do not connect at the same time.
The CPU mode of the main unit should be "HIGH".Also, EMS page with standard 256 color display function
The EMS function is not used because the memory address of the frame (C000H segment) is used.
Choose.When installing the display driver, the installer
When EMM386.exe is found, its option switch is automatically rewritten, EMS page
The frame address is shifted or set to not use EMS.Resume
Function not supported.
For models with built-in sound function such as PC-486NOTE AS, the sound of the main unit
Set BIOS to "do not use".
