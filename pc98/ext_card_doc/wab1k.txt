WAB-1000, WAB-2000, WAP-2000, WAP-4000, WSR-G, WSR-E (メルコ)

Graphic accelerator board for C bus.Graphic chip
For WAB-1000, WAB-2000, WSR-G, and WSR-E, Cirrus Logic CL-GD5428,
In addition, WAP-2000 and WAP-4000 are equipped with the company's CL-GD5434.Image memory
1 MB for WAB-1000, WSR-G, WSR-E, 2 MB for WAB-2000 and WAP-2000,
WAP-4000 is 4 MB. These boards are from the Melco CD-ROM drive,
"CDO-EY" can be connected (connected to the interface board supplied with the CDO-EY)
Cable required: but this CD-ROM drive is 32-bit for Windows 95
There is no driver, and on Windows 95, the driver for DOS is embedded
I have to use it in MS-DOS compatible mode).WSR-G is another FM sound source
(26K compatible) and PCM sound source, WSR-E is also equipped with PCM sound source.
There is one rotary switch on the board.

・ Rotary switch SW1: I / O port address setting
　0 = 4xE0H, 4xE1H, 5xE0H, 5xE1H, 46E8H (factory setting)
　1 = 4xE2H, 4xE3H, 5xE2H, 5xE3H, 46E8H
　2 = 4xE4H, 4xE5H, 5xE4H, 5xE5H, 46E8H
　3 = 4xE6H, 4xE7H, 5xE6H, 5xE7H, 46E8H
　4 = not settable
　5 = 4xEAH, 4xEBH, 5xEAH, 5xEBH, 46E8H
　6 = 4xECH, 4xEDH, 5xECH, 5xEDH, 46E8H
　7 = 4xEEH, 4xEFH, 5xEEH, 5xEFH, 46E8H
　* X means the use of all 0 / F I / O ports.

In WSR-G, there are 3 other 3 jumper switches on the board.The characters on the board are
When looking at the board in the upright orientation, · Jumper switch JP12: FM sound source use / nonuse setting
Left-center short = FM sound source use / not use
Right-center short = FM source not used
・ Jumper switch JP13: Interrupt setting
Left-center short = INT 5
Right-center short = INT 6
・ Jumper switch JP22: Not described in the manual.

I received the following information from Mr. Matsubayashi.
-------------------------------------------------------- ----------------
There are three other 3 pin jumpers on WSR-G, and I changed it.
I did not know if it had changed.
I thought I would change the resources used on DOS, but yes
It does not seem to be.
In addition, Windows 95 driver of this board does not use INT 5
It has become.
I do not know if the FM sound source unit is separated in hardware.
