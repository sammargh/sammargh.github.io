RSA-98 II / S (I･Oデータ)

C bus high-speed RS-232C expansion board (start-stop synchronization).Equipped with 1 serial port.For sending / receiving
A 2048Byte FIFO is mounted on the (total 8KB).Two rotary switches and 2x7 jumpers on the board
There is one switch and one 6-line jumper switch.
Adopting TL16C550C made by TEXAS INSTRUMENTS as serial control LSI, transfer of up to 230.4 Kbps
Communication is possible at speed (master clock 14.7456 MHz).The data bus is DB0-7.Maximum power consumption + 5V, 370mA
/ + 12V, 20mA / -12V, 20mA. Operating environment: temperature 0-40 ° C / humidity 20-80% (no condensation).Extended I / O
Possible to use in unit.
Additional RS-232C port can be added by using multiple RSA-98, RSA-98SB and RSA-98II / S.In attached BIOS
Up to 32 RS-232C ports can be controlled with up to 32 lines, or with COM driver for Windows 3.1 up to 7 lines (Windows NT
COM driver for 3.5x and Windows 95 supports only one RSA-98 series: Windows NT 3.5x and
Multiple use of RSA-98, RSA-98SB and RSA-98II / S is not possible on Windows 95).
Set up and use flow control to prevent data loss.Enable hard flow control
In order to do this, always use a cable with RTS / CTS and DTR / DSR signal lines connected.

・ Rotary switch RSW2, RSW1: Setting of upper 8 bits of I / O port address
Set to 00h to FFh.The factory setting is 50h.In this case, set RSW2 to 5 and RSW1 to 0.
Note 1: In the PC-9821 series, since the upper 8 bits x8h to xFh of the I / O port address are reserved,
　　 Set in the range of x0h to x7h.
Note 2: The lower 8 bits of I / O port address are fixed by hardware as follows.
(1) TL16C550C control port
   xxE0h, xxE2h, xxE4h, xxE6h, xxE8h, xxEAh, xxECh, xxEEh
   xxE1h, xxE3h, xxE5h, xxE7h, xxE9h, xxEBh, xxEDh, xxEFh
　 For 16550 mode, use 8 consecutive bytes from the base I / O address.For example, base I / O address
　 In the case of xx38h, it is xx38h to xx3Fh.
(2) Port address for transmission / reception FIFO (RSA-98 mode)
   xxD0h, xxD2h, xxD4h, xxD6h
   xxD1h, xxD3h, xxD5h, xxD7h
(3) Mode setting port address
   xx DAh)
※ When used with GA-98NB series, the I / O port address will be duplicated if it is the factory setting (50h) and normal
　Do not work.In this case, the upper 8 bits of the base I / O port address of RSA-98 other than 40h to 5Fh (GA-98 NBI / C
　When using in combination with this, please set it so as not to overlap with other boards.

・ 2 × 7 jumper switch JP1: Setting of interrupt level
Below, the order of interrupt levels and pins to be shorted
INT 0 ■ INT 0 2 vertical (default setting)
INT 1 ■ INT 2 on the left next to INT 0
INT 2 ■ INT 2 next to 2 0 2 vertically
Three next to INT 3 ■ INT 0 2 vertically
Next to the four INT 41 ■ INT 0 2 vertically
One next to INT 5 ■ INT 6
INT 6 ■ INT 6 2 vertical
No interrupt ■ 1 top of INT 6 and 1 top right (with jumper plug facing sideways)

・ 6 stations jumper switch SW1: mode setting
1: 16550 compatible mode / switching of RSA-98 compatible mode
　 16550 compatible mode ■ RSA-98 compatible mode □
　　　　　　　　　　□ (Factory setting) ■
2: Hardware flow enable / disable switching
　 Hardware flow enable ■ Hardware flow disable □
　 (Factory setting: usually not changed) □ ■
3-4-5-6: Lower base I / O port address when using 16550 mode

Note: xx is the same as the settings of RSW2 and RSW1 (factory setting 50h).


About COM driver
(1) COM driver for Windows 95
-The base I / O port address of RSA-98 is fixed at 50h at the factory setting.
-"Multifunction Adapter" and "Extended Serial Board (RSA-98)" in Device Manager
　Click in the order of.Then set both ports to the same IRQ in "Properties".
・ After setup, "Extended serial board" (RSA-98) (COM 2) and "Extended serial board"
　(RSA-98) (COM3) is registered and it is COM3!There is a mark, but there is no problem in operation.
(2) COM driver for Windows NT3.x
・ The base I / O port address of RSA-98 is fixed to factory default 50h, and the interrupt level is fixed to INT 0.
　It is done.
・ When copying of driver files is completed, in [Mouse:] of [Windows NT setup]
　[I-O-DATA high-speed serial board RSA-98 series] is displayed, but it ends as it is.
　After rebooting, change [Mouse:] to [Use PC-9800 mouse].
When using these drivers, use the RSA-98 series BIOS or RSA-98 series serial driver.
Do not incorporate.
※ It is abbreviation about BIOS / driver for MS-DOS, Windows 3.1.
