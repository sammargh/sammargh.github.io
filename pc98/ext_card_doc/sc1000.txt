※ # 2 is PC-9801VM / UV2 / UV11 (Note 1), PC-286U (Note 1), PC-286L / LE / LF
　Used only with the I / O expansion unit (PC 286 LIOU) attached (Note 2)
　Possible.However, with dip switches on the PC and I / O expansion unit,
　Fix the built-in FDD or connection FDD to 2DD.
Note 1: When using # 0 / # 2, use expansion slot 2 or # 0 / # 3
　If this is the case, attach this I / F to expansion slot 1.
Note 2: When using the PC 286 LIOU, set the ROM address of this I / F to D4000h to D4FFFh
