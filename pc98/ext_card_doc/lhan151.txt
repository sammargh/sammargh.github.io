LHA-N151 (Logitec)

Multi-Vendor non-compliant old 98 note 110-pin expansion bus SCSI I / F.
SCSI-2 compliant but not Windows 95 compliant (55 boards in DMA transfer mode
Driver for LHA-20B in super I / O transfer mode
And usage of drivers for 55 boards).Transfer speed at DOS is the same
Among the types of SCSI I / F, along with ICM's IF-2660
It is said.Other 110-pin bus through output connector
Because it is equipped, the size is large.Consumption current is terminator power
When supplying 260 mA, when not supplying 140 mA.
There is one 8-deep dip switch.

・ 8 stations dip switch SW1: terminator power, DMA channel,
　Memory address, interrupt level, transfer mode setting
1: Setting of terminator power
　Supply ON terminator power (factory setting)
　OFF ■ Do not supply terminator power
2: DMA channel setting
　ON CH 3 (factory setting)
　OFF CH 0
3-4: Memory address setting
　ON-ON x DE 000 h to x DEF FF
　ON-OFF xDC000h to xDCFFFh (factory setting)
　OFF-ON xD6000h to xD6FFFh
　OFF-OFF ■ ■ xD4000h ~ xD4FFFh　 
5: Interrupt level setting
　ON ■ INT 3
　OFF INT 0 (factory setting)
6: Transfer mode setting
　ON DMA transfer
　OFF Super I / O transfer (default setting)
7-8: Always ON-ON (system use)
