REX-PCI32 (RATOC SYSTEMS)

PCI bus master SCSI I / F. equipped with initio INIC-950P PC-9821, PC / AT
Compatible machine compatible.Physical format support.Rewritable for SCSI-BIOS
Adopt flash memory.
Does not support OD-502 compatible mode of PC-9821.PC-9821 MS-DOS and Windows 3.1
In the above, multi vendor is realized by attached REXDISK.SYS.Non-multi on Windows
Vendor.
I / O port address = xx00h to xxFFh (assigned from PCI BIOS).
BIOS memory = 32K memory space (assigned from PCI BIOS).
Power consumption = Usually 1000mW (+ 5V).
In Windows Device Manager Disk Drive Properties Display
Since "synchronous data transfer" is not enabled, the SCSI-BIOS setting menu
Set transfer method by.
The CD-ROM drive connected to the secondary master may be
Sometimes it can not be used.In that case the secondary slave or
Connection to primary slave.
From MS-DOS, Windows 3.1 using CD-ROM connected to REX-PCI32 with PC-9821
When installing Windows 98, create a startup menu
Installation stops at the point.
　In order to avoid this, during the installation of Windows 98 (the second
　　CONFIG.SYS on the drive on which Windows 98 is installed)
　Delete the lines describing ASP950N.SYS and REXCD.SYS from.
PCI bus clock in asynchronous mode for models with a base clock of 66 MHz or more
Use at (fixed at 33 MHz).In addition, PC100 standard (base clock 100 MHz)
For the model, set the PCI bus clock to be 33 MHz.
If it hangs up when connecting MO drive, FUJITSU M2512A / M2513A,
Set the maximum synchronous transfer rate to 10MB / s in the setting screen of SCSI-BIOS.
When connecting an image scanner, NEC PC-IN 700 / 3S (MultiReader 300)
It does not operate normally unless it is set to asynchronous transfer on the setting screen of SCSI-BIOS.

50 and 68 pins for internal flat cable connector, D-sub connector for external connector
Half 50 pin.The simultaneous connection of devices is only possible with 2 connectors.Two on the board
There is 1 jumper and 4 signal pins.

・ 2 jumpers JP1: for maintenance.Factory setting = open, no short.
・ 4 signal pins JP3: Signal connector for lighting SCSI bus (3 and 4 in case of 2 ports)
　1,4 = power supply
　2, 3 = signal (active low)
