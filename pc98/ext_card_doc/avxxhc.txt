Using this board, EMS compatible RAM board and FM sound board simultaneously
Impossible.In the EMS compatible RAM board, set the start address of EMS to C0000h.
Note that some models have restrictions on the C bus slot that can be installed.
Also, when using with external FDD I / F, change switch setting on FDD I / F
Sometimes you need
Remove the switch pin on the side of the card edge when using it on a V30 machine
about.
Two 8-deep dip switches and one 4-deep dip switch on the board,
1 x 2 x 4 series jumper switch, 1 x 3 jumper switch, 2 x 3 series
There is one jumper switch and one 2x2 series jumper switch.

・ 8-station dip switch SW1: SCSI ID of I / F section, interrupt level,
　DMA channel setting
1-2-3: Setting SCSI ID in I / F section
　ON-ON-ON-ON 7 (default setting)
　Usually, use with the factory settings.
4-5-6: Setting interrupt level
　OFF-OFF-OFF INT0 (IRQ 3)
　ON-OFF-OFF INT1 (IRQ 5)
　OFF-ON-OFF INT2 (IRQ 6)
　ON-ON-OFF INT3 (IRQ 9) (Factory setting)
　OFF-OFF-ON INT5 (IRQ 12)
　ON-OFF-ON INT 6 (IRQ 13)
7-8: DMA channel setting
　ON-ON # 3
　OFF-OFF # 0 (default setting)

・ 8 stations dip switch SW2: Setting of local memory address and main unit model
1-2-3: Normal mode local memory address
　OFF-ON-ON DC000h to DCFFFh (factory setting)
4-5: Local memory address in high resolution mode
　OFF-ON EC000h to ECFFFh (factory setting)
6-7: Setting of machine model
　OFF-OFF PC-98XA
　ON-OFF V30 machine (protected mode non-support model)
　Models with OFF-ON Normal / Hi-Res Both modes
　ON-ON ■ Only normal mode that supports protected mode
　　　　 Model (default setting)
8: Always on

-4 stations dip switch SW3: SCSI ID setting of HDD section
　OFF-OFF-OFF-OFF 0 (default setting)
　ON-OFF-OFF-OFF 1
　OFF-ON-OFF-OFF 2
　ON-ON-OFF-OFF 3
　OFF-OFF-ON-OFF 4
　ON-OFF-ON-OFF 5
　OFF-ON-ON-OFF 6

・ 2 x 4 jumper switch JP1: Setting of hold request channel
With the hold request channel, separate the bus use right from the CPU
Request channel for exclusive use.
　1-8 short, 2-7 short ■ Hold request channel 1 (factory setting)
　3-6 short, 4-5 short ■ Hold request channel 2
In addition to this board, there is an I / F that uses the hold request channel
In case of hold request channel 2 set.

・ Three jumper switch JP2: Always short between center pin-1 pin (modification prohibited)

・ 2 x 3 jumper switch JP3: I / O port address, transfer mode setting
(1) I / O port setting
　2-5, 3-4 short ■ CC0h, CC2h, CC4h, CC6h (factory setting)
　2-5 short, 3-4 open ■ CD0h, CD2h, CD4h, CD6h
　2-5 open, 3-4 short ■ CE0h, CE2h, CE4h, CE6h
　2-5 open, 3-4 open ■ CF0h, CF2h, CF4h, CF6h
(2) Setting of transfer mode
　1-6 open ■ Bus master transfer
　1-6 short ■ Forced DMA transfer
Valid on 80386/80486 machines only.Regardless of the transfer mode setting on V30 machines
This is I / O string transfer, and DMA transfer for 80286 machines.Also, DMA transfer is performed on OS / 2 and PC-UX.

・ 2x2 jumper switch JP4: Always short between 1 and 4 (change prohibited)
