WRY-16 (98), RRY-16 (98) (CONTEC)

Mercury / reed relay contact output module.WRY-16 (98) is a mercury relay,
RRY-16 (98) mounts regular reed relays respectively.16 output signals in total
Contact, positive logic.The next instruction is executed for the signal output to the output port
Keep that state until.All outputs are OFF (break) at power on
It becomes a state.WRY-16 (98) has conditions in the mounting direction, so it is made of CONTEC
Use within the I / O expansion unit "FA-PAC (98)".
There are two 8-deep dip switches on the board.

■ WRY-16 (98) specifications
Contact rating (MAX): switching capacity = 50 W, switching voltage = 500 V DC, switching current = 1 A

Recovery time = 2 ms or less
Power supply capacity = +5 V, 1.5 mA
Operating condition = 0 to 50 °, 20 to 90% (no condensation)
Response time = Within 3 ms after instruction execution
Used relay = NEC UMD1A-05
■ RRY-16 (98) specifications
Contact rating (MAX): switching capacity = 5 W, switching voltage = DC 50 V, switching current = 100 mA,
                 Energized current = 200mA
Contact resistance = 150mΩ or less
Operating time = 0.1 to 0.3 ms
Recovery time = 0.1 ms or less
Power supply capacity = +5 V, 500 mA
Operating condition = 0 to 50 °, 20 to 90% (no condensation)
Response time = within 0.5 ms after instruction execution
Used relay = NEC PG1A-05

・ 8-station dip switches SW1 and SW2: I / O port address setting
Each dip of each switch corresponds to ON and OFF to 0 respectively.Therefore
For example, when setting to F0D0h, 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8 of each switch is
SW1: 1-1-1-0-0-0-0
SW2: 1-0-1-0-0-0-0
Set toAs a rule, specify the lower 2 digit port numbers D0 to DFh.
Note: 8 of SW2 is invalid (divided into 2 pairs of ports in this I / F board)

The correspondence between output port address and data is as follows:
-Configured port address + 0
  For D7-D6-D5-D4-D3-D2-D1-D0, O7-O6-O5-O4-O3-O2-O1-O0
-Configured port address + 1
  O15-O14-O13-O12-O11-O10-O9-O8 against D7-D6-D5-D4-D3-D2-D1-D0
The LEDs on the board are O0, O1, O2 ... from the bottom when the card edge is seen to the right.
