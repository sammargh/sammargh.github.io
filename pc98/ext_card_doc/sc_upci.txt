SC-U2PCI (I･Oデータ)

PCI ver. 2.0 / 2.1 compliant SCSI-3 compliant bus master transfer SCSI H / A. PnP compatible.
Compatible with PC-9821 / PC-98NX / PC / AT compatible machines.Only multi-vendor compatible with PC-98.
Interrupt level, I / O port address, BIOS address are automatically set.
Operating temperature range 5 to 55 °.Maximum power consumption +5 V = 400 mA, +12 V = 40 mA.
In PC-98NX, support software programs that run on DOS can not be used.
Also, it may not work depending on the installed PCI slot.
Up to two connectors can simultaneously load SCSI devices in a three-connector lot
Connection available.
There are 6 types of substrates by lot.
