Top row from the right B10, B9, B8 ..... B3, B2, B1 and bottom row from the right
A10, A9, when viewed with the A8 ····· A3, A2, A1, pin assignment is as below.
The following is the order of the terminal number, signal name, and explanation:

A1 O00 + 0 port output (lower) B1 O 08 +1 port output (lower) 
A2 O01 + 0 port output (lower) B2 O09 +1 port output (lower) 
A3 O02 + 0 port output (lower) B3 O 10 +1 port output (lower) 
A4 O03 + 0 port output (lower) B4 O 11 +1 port output (lower) 
A5 COM1 + 0 port lower common B5 COM 3 +1 port lower common 
A6 O04 + 0 port output (upper) B6 O12 +1 port output (upper) 
A7 O05 +0 port output (upper) B7 O13 +1 port output (upper) 
A8 O06 + 0 port output (upper) B8 O 14 +1 port output (upper) 
A9 O07 +0 port output (upper) B9 O15 +1 port output (upper) 
A10 COM2 +0 port upper common B10 COM4 +1 port upper common
The commons (COM 1 to 4) on the board are independent of each other in the board.
