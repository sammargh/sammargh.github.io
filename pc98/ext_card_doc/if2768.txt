IF-2768 (ICM)

Multi-vendor compatible C bus bus master SCSI I / F. More than 16MB of memory
Bus master transfer is possible even on the main unit.The revision of BIOS ROM is 2.00 or later and compatible with Windows 95.
On Windows 95 compatible version, the letter M is printed on an amber ground outside the external SCSI connector
The round seal is attached.
There is one 8 series dip switch and one 10 jumper switch on the board.

Settings such as interrupt level, DMA channel, transfer mode, etc., at startup / reset of main unit
Set on the setting menu screen that is displayed by holding down the [CTRL] + [S] keys at.
Quick format and disk parameters can be set for each connected HDD.
If the disk parameter is set to "ANL", the HDD parameter
Automatic analysis is performed.To start the HDD parameter analysis program manually, start the main unit
/ Hold down the [CTRL] + [A] key at the time of reset.

・ 8 stations dip switch SW1: Setting of main unit model
　OFF-ON-ON-OFF-ON-ON-ON-ON ■ Model only in normal mode (default setting)
　OFF-ON-ON-OFF-ON-OFF-ON-ON
　※ Memory address is DC000h to DCFFFh in normal mode, EC000h to ECFFFh in high res mode.

・ 10 jumper switch: Function unknown
　Always use at factory setting (short between 4-5, 9-10)

【The following is common to IF-2767 / 2768/2769】
Valuestar for PC-9821V7 or later, MATE-X for PC-9821Xa7e / Xb10 or later, PC-9821Cb3
Since the specification of C bus has been changed in CanBe later, IF-2767 / 2768/2769
C bus memory refresh of PC when using in bus master mode
It is necessary to output a signal.The C bus memory refresh signal is
Send when holding down [ESC] + [HELP] + [5] at startup of the machine,
Stop by holding down [ESC] + [HELP] + [6] while starting up the machine
It is done.Problems when C bus memory refresh signal is sent (turned on)
And the measures are as follows:
(1) EMM 386.It does not operate normally when EXE is not incorporated
　→ EMM 386 in CONFIG.SYS.Incorporate the EXE.However, EMM 386 attached to MS-DOS made by NEC.EXE
　　Other third-party EMS memory managers are not certified.
(2) It does not operate normally in the safe mode of Windows 95
　→ Stop the C bus memory refresh signal when starting up in the safe mode,
　　Set the data transfer method of this board to FIFO or DMA.
(3) When using DPMI (used by MS-DOS version Ichitaro ver.5 etc.) with MS-DOS ver.5.0 / 5.0A
　 Hang-up
　→ Use MS-DOS ver. 6.2 or higher.DPMI drivers from manufacturers other than NEC
　　Operation is not guaranteed.
* These problems occur regardless of whether or not IF-2767 / 2768/2769 is used.
