HA-FA02W (Nippon Teksa)

SCSI board inserted in dedicated SCSI_I / F slot of PC-9801FA, FS, FX, mate-A series.
Multi-vendor support by parameter setting but Win95 non-support (Japanese Texa released Win95
Before withdrawal from the PC-98 peripherals market).When using Win95, transfer mode is DMA transfer
Set it and let the 55 board driver recognize it.
The transfer mode is DMA transfer and I / O transfer (W-GT mode) because it is for dedicated SCSI_I / F slot.
Only, there is no bus master mode.
Silk printing on a substrate is described in EZ P 0184 A.
Recognition of this board that I examined using e10chk.exe which is free software created by Mr. Marimo
The capacity limit was 2015 MB.
The setting method is basically the same as HA-55BS4 except JP3.
JP3 on the board should be shorted when enabling SCSI_ROM and open when disabled (disconnected).
