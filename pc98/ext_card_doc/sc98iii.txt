SC-98III, SC-98IIIP, SC-98IIISB, SC-98IIIPSB (I・Oデータ)

Multi-vendor PnP-compatible C-bus SMIT SCSI board (in high resolution mode
PnP mode can not be used).The shape of the SCSI connector is SC-98III and SC-98IIISB
In the case of anphenol half pitch 50 pin, in the SC-98IIIP and SC-98IIIPSB
D sub half 50 pin.SC-98III and SC-98IIIP are based on second bus TYPE II
Board, also SC-98IIISB and SC-98IIIPSB are second bus type II daughter boards.
Power consumption +12 V = 100 mA, +5 V = 500 mA. The BIOS ROM revision is 1.04 or later
It supports MMX Pentium, but the transfer speed drops on machines with MMP Pentium.
Not compatible with I / O data extension BOX.Also, combined use with GA-968V is not possible.Also SDB
SDB series support software is ver. 1.80 or later
It does not work normally in SMIT transfer (from a CD-ROM connected to SC-98III (P)
It becomes impossible to read out.There is no problem with removable media etc.Also I / O transfer
And no problem with DMA transfer).
There is one double dip switch and one double jumper switch on the board.

Interrupt level, DMA channel, ROM address, machine type (high resolution
Mode) and transfer method, press [CTRL] + [GRAPH] + [S] immediately after the main unit starts.
Set in the setup menu to start.Setup menu is displayed
If not, set the support software disk to FDD.
I will ask "Do you want to update the BIOS after rebooting", so "N"
Choice).
The interrupt levels are INT 0 (IRQ 3), INT 1 (IRQ 5), INT 2 (IRQ 6), INT 3 (IRQ 9) 
And DMA channel is selected from CH 0 or CH 3 (automatically set in PnP mode).
Also, I / O port address in non-PnP mode is fixed at CC0h to CC7h.When the resource ships
The setting is INT 0 (IRQ 3), DMA CH 3, ROM address DC000h (in normal mode)
Or EC 000 h (in high resolution mode).
The parameter analysis of the HDD is displayed on the screen after the memory count is finished
When [ID] and [Device] are displayed, press [CTRL] + [GRAPH] + [P] to activate.
Use an automatic analysis utility.Parameter display of automatic analysis is actual
It may appear much smaller than the capacity, but there is no problem in use.
Manually input the parameter if automatic analysis fails (
Ask or use the multi-vendor function auxiliary program HDDP.HDDP
Unavailable on Windows 95).

-Dual dip switch: switching between PnP and non-PnP modes
　OFF-OFF = PnP mode
　OFF-ON = non-PnP mode

・ 2 jumper switches: No description of functions in manual.Factory setting: Short
In 98JUNK.DOC, it is said that PC-98XA is open, but I confirm the actual operation
Not done.
