・ 8-station dip switches SW1 and SW2: I / O port address setting
Set the start address of the port group used by the board with SW1 and SW2.Let's set
Set the corresponding bit switch to ON according to the port address to be set.
Since 8 pairs of ports are occupied in this I / F, the start port address is a multiple of 8
Setting.
Example: 01D0h
　SW1: OFF-OFF-OFF-OFF-OFF-OFF-OFF-OFF-ON
　SW2: ON-ON-OFF-ON-OFF-OFF-OFF-OFF
CONTEC recommends the range of ** D0H to ** DFH (* is any value from 0 to F).
Input / output in assembler program is to register indirect input instruction by DX register

In the case of 1 to 6, set the memory address. When 7 is ON, the memory is not selected.ROM
If you do not use the writer function, 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8,
Set to ON-ON-OFF-OFF-OFF-ON-ON-OFF.

Pin number (signal name) JP1 pin interrupt
　　　49 (L-PC0) 1 INT0
　　　46 (L-PC3) 2 INT4
      24 (H-PC0) 3 INT5
      21 (H-PC3) 4 INT6
An interrupt occurs at the rise of the input signal from OFF to ON.In addition, interrupt
When used, other I / F interrupts must not be used at the same level
(Wired or not available).Jumper when not using interrupt
To remove.

・ 3x4 jumper switch JP2: Not described in the manual
　Factory setting: All open

■ About hardware interrupt
(1) In the PC-9801 series, two interrupt controllers μPD8259 are cascade-connected
　 doing.To use an interrupt, mask reset the μPD8259 and
   The table address must be registered.
a) Correspondence between interrupt levels and mask bits in the μPD8259:
　INT 0: Master 8259 (02h port) D3 bit
　INT 5: slave 8259 (0 Ah port) D4 bit
　INT 6: slave 8259 (0 Ah port) D5 bit
　By resetting the port bit shown above, interrupts are enabled,
　Interrupts are disabled by setting a bit.
　Example) Allow INT 0, INT 5
　　IN AL, 02h; Acquisition of current mask state
　　AND AL, 0F7h; Clear bit corresponding to INT 0
    OUT 02h, AL; set a new mask state
　　IN AL, 0Ah; Acquisition of current mask state
　　AND AL, 0EFh; Clear bit corresponding to INT 5
    OUT 0Ah, AL; Set a new mask state
b) Interrupt level and interrupt processing destination registration address
　INT 0: From segment 0h / offset 2Ch
　INT 5: From segment 0h / offset 50h
　INT 6: From segment 0h / offset 54h
　Start address of interrupt processing program from the address shown above
　Register in order of offset and segment.
　Example: The interrupt processing destination address of INT 0 is segment 1E00h, offset 100h,
　　　Also, the interrupt processing destination address of INT 5 is segment 1E00h, offset 200h
　　　in the case of
　　MOV AX, 0; Segment 0 set
    MOV DS, AX; INT 0
    MOV WORD PTR [2Ch], 100h; Offset registration
    MOV WORD PTR [2Eh], 1E00h; Segment registration
                              ; INT 5
    MOV WORD PTR [50h], 200h; Offset registration
    MOV WORD PTR [52h], 1E00h; Segment registration
(2) Interrupt processing program
a) Saving of registers used for interrupt processing
b) Interrupt processing
c) Reset of interrupt controller μPD8259
　　MOV AL, 20h; EOI command set
  　OUT 0, AL: Reset of master μPD 8259
  　OUT 8, AL; reset of slave μPD 8259
　However, in the case of INT 0, it is not necessary to reset the slave μPD8259.
d) Register return + IRET
