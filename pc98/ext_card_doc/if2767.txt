IF-2767 (ICM)

Multi-vendor non-compliant C bus bus master SCSI I / F. Corresponding body is
Equipped with 286 or more CPUs.Windows 95 compatible.SCSI connector is
Amphenol half 50 pin.PC-9821Xa7e / Xb10 / V7 / Cb3 or later
When using the model in the bus master mode, memory on the C bus
Need to output refresh signal (Windows in safe mode
Stop the memory refresh signal and start the transfer mode.
Change to DMA transfer or W-FIFO transfer).
2 8 dip switches and 1 4 dip switch on the board,
2x2 2x jumper switch 1x 2x 2 jumper switch x 2x 5x
There is one jumper switch.

· 8 stations dip switch SW1: SCSI ID number of this board, interrupt level,
　DMA channel setting
1-2-3: SCSI ID number setting
　OFF-OFF-OFF 0
　ON-OFF-OFF 1
　OFF-ON-OFF 2
　ON-ON-OFF 3
　OFF-OFF-ON 4
　ON-OFF-ON 5
　OFF-ON-ON 6
　ON-ON-ON 7 (default setting)
4-5-6: Setting interrupt level
　OFF-OFF-OFF INT 0 (factory setting)
　ON-OFF-OFF INT 1
　OFF-ON-OFF INT 2
　ON-ON-OFF INT 3
　OFF-OFF-ON INT 5
　ON-OFF-ON INT 6
7-8: DMA channel setting
　OFF-OFF # 0
　ON-ON # 3 (default setting)
※ In FIFO mode, DMA is not used at data transfer but status
　Use DMA when executing commands such as.

・ 8 stations dip switch SW2: local memory address (1-2-3-4-5),
　Main unit model setting (6-7)
(8 is always ON. Default setting: OFF-ON-ON-OFF-ON-ON-OFF-ON)
The following shows the main unit model ■ DIP switch settings ■ Memory address order:
Model only in normal mode ■ OFF-ON-ON-OFF-ON-ON-ON-ON
　　　　　　　　　　　　 ■ \ DC 000 h ~ \ DC F FF h (factory setting)
　Normal / Hi-Res dual-purpose machine ■ OFF-ON-ON-OFF-ON-OFF-OFF-ON-ON
　　　　　　　　　　　　　■ Normal mode \ DC 000 h ~ \ DCF FF h
　　　　　　　　　　　　　/ During high res mode \ EC 000 h ~ \ ECFFF h
　※ \ is 0h or Fh.
　※ We have high res mode when using with B4670II (PC-9864L)
　　Be sure to turn on SW2 4-5 on the main unit.In this case local
　　The memory address is set to \ EE000h to \ EEFFFh.

・ 4 stations dip switch SW3: I / O port address, transfer mode setting
1-2: I / O port address setting
　Only ON-ON (default setting) can be set.It will not work if you change it.
　Bus master / DMA transfer CC0h, CC2h, CC4h, FIFO transfer
　CC0h, CC2h, CC4h, CC6h, CC7h.
3-4: Transfer mode setting
　OFF-ON ■ Synchronous bus master transfer
　ON-ON Asynchronous bus master transfer (factory setting)
　ON-OFF W-FIFO transfer
　OFF-OFF DMA transfer
　※ FIFO transfer is not possible on machines with the 8086.Also H98, PC-386S, PRO-486
　　In this case, bus master transfer is not possible.
　※ FIFO transfer can not be used when using with GP-IB board.

The jumper switch is not described in the manual.
・ 2 x 2 series jumper switch JP1
　Factory setting: 1 (L)-4, 2 (H)-3 short circuit

・ 2 jumper switch JP2
　Factory setting: Open (2 pins have one hole of jumper plug
　　　　　　　　　　　  Plug in)
　※ CPU speed is Middle or Low at bus master transfer with Ap / As / Ae
　　There seems to be a case where setting change is required in case of, but details are unknown.

・ 2 x 5 series jumper switch JP3
　Factory setting: 1-10, 3-8 short, 2-9, 4-7, 5-6 open

・ 2 jumper switch JP4 (exactly 6 through holes of JP4 (solder
　Jumper pins are planted only in 2 and 3)
　Factory setting: 2-3 shorts

※ About the factory setting of the jumper switch: I have so far several dozens
　I have seen this board, but all were the settings above, so this was shipped
　Think of it as a time setting.

【The following is common to IF-2767 / 2768/2769】
Valuestar for PC-9821V7 or later, mate-X for PC-9821Xa7e / Xb10 or later, PC-9821Cb3
Since the specification of C bus has been changed in CanBe later, IF-2767 / 2768/2769
C bus memory refresh of PC when using in bus master mode
It is necessary to output a signal.The C bus memory refresh signal is
Send when holding down [ESC] + [HELP] + [5] at startup of the machine,
Stop by holding down [ESC] + [HELP] + [6] while starting up the machine
It is done.Problems when C bus memory refresh signal is sent (turned on)
And the measures are as follows:
(1) EMM 386.It does not operate normally when EXE is not incorporated
　→ EMM 386 in CONFIG.SYS.Incorporate the EXE.However, EMM 386 attached to MS-DOS made by NEC.EXE
　　Other third-party EMS memory managers are not certified.
(2) It does not operate normally in the safe mode of Windows 95
　→ Stop the C bus memory refresh signal when starting up in the safe mode,
　　Set the data transfer method of this board to FIFO or DMA.
(3) When using DPMI (used by MS-DOS version Ichitaro ver.5 etc.) with MS-DOS ver.5.0 / 5.0A
　 Hang-up
　→ Use MS-DOS ver. 6.2 or higher.DPMI drivers from manufacturers other than NEC
　　Operation is not guaranteed.
* These problems occur regardless of whether or not IF-2767 / 2768/2769 is used.
