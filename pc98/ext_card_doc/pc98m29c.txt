Adapter for (C bus board).Attach not IDE to SCSI conversion board
The HDD that has been created is recognized as an IDE HDD.There is no character of PC98M29C on the board,
PC98M29A on the main board, daughter board (connector with HDD pack)
There is PC98M29B silk print on the top.ROM address is D8000h to D9FFFh, work
RAM addresses for DA000h to DBFFFh.The I / O port address is 064xh, 074xh, 
0 CFxh (x = 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, A, C, E).

A case sold as a single board and an HDD pack made by Caravelle are attached
It seems that there were cases where it was sold in the
The theory that only HDDs with the capacity installed can be recognized
(Note 1) Unconfirmed.Although the format upper limit and recognition upper limit are unknown,
The author has confirmed that it can be used up to 540 MB properly.Also below this
In terms of capacity, Windows 95 can be used without problems (Notes 2 and 3).
Note 1: There is a story that the position of the chip resistance on the board is changed to perform capacity limitation.
　　 There is, but it is hard to think as long as you look at the substrate.
Note 2: But 540 MB HDD [I • O data, HDN-540M: Fujitsu MK1924FCV,
　　In the case of 543 MB (Cyl 1053, H 16, S 63)], the HDB 98 (ver .1.20, on MS-DOS)
　　The capacity is misrecognized in Marimo's work) (Model: PC-9821As2 / U2 + DX2 ODP):

・ 8 stations dip switch SW1: Setting of main unit model
1-2-3-4-5-6: Always OFF-ON-ON-ON-ON-ON
7: Setting of machine type
　Models with ON = 80286 or more
　Model of OFF = V30
8: Always on

・ 2 jumper switch JP1: Setting of main unit clock
　Other than short = 12 MHz
　Open = 12 MHz
