Power Window 801, 801+, 928 (Canopus)

C bus graphic accelerator board.Graphics chip is Power Window 801
The S3 company 86C801 and the Power Window 928 are equipped with the S3 company 86C928.VRAM 1MB
(With Power Window 928 VRAM expansion kit 928-1M (Model No. CIM-1137-01) 2MB VRAM
Can be added toMaximum current consumption is +5 V, 810 mA for Power Window 801/801 +
/ +12 V, 40 mA, 928 for VRAM 1 MB + 5 V, 930 mA / + 12 V, 40 mA, VRAM 2 MB + 5 V, 940 mA
/ +12 V, 40 mA.
In PowerWindow801 / 801 +, 2 rotary switches and 8 series dip switches on the board
There are one and two jumper switches. In 928, one further six dip switches, three
One jumper switch and two jumper switches are added.
Operation is not guaranteed on machines with CPU accelerator (Operation of machines with ODP is guaranteed). 
The main unit's GCD clock should be used at 5 MHz.In PC-9801FA, 61 on internal expansion RAM board
Compatible SIMMs should be used with 5 or less (mounted memory 13.6 MB or less).

・ Rotary switch R-DPSW1: I / O port address setting
Standard (shipment) I / O port address: 
06D0-06DF, 16D0-16DF, 26D-26DF, 36D0-36DF 
46D0-46DF, 56D0-56DF, 66D-66DF, 76D0-76DF 
86D0-86DF, 96D0-96DF, A6D-A6DF, B6D0-B6DF 
C6D0-C6DF, D6D0-D6DF, E6D-E6DF, F6D0-F6DF
The second digit from the left of each I / O port address “6” on the rotary switch R-DPSW1
It can be changed between 1-7 by setting. 
Software called "PWIO.EXE" is included to check how to set R-DPSW1.
This is done before setting the board to the PC. 
On LAN boards where the I / O port address to be used overlaps with the Power Window, use PWIO.EXE
Execution may cause a malfunction.In such a case, unplug the LAN cable
Run PWIO.EXE in state. 

・ Rotary switch VR1: Quick saver time setting
Set the time for the quick saver that realizes the screen saver function in hardware.
Quick saver function ON / OFF is setup program and control software
Set this VR1 to darken the screen if there is no access for a while
Do with.Turning clockwise will increase this time (about 4 to 5 minutes at maximum).

・ 2 jumper switch JP2: compared to when not using Power Window
If the display seems too bright, remove the jumper plug (short plug). 

・ 8 stations dip switch S1: Memory space specification
Basically, no change is required (Factory setting: ON-ON-ON-ON-OFF-OFF-OFF-OFF-OFF).
The memory space uses 128KB from F00000H by default (within the system reserved area).
However, with PC-486GF / GR / GR + / GR Super / P, the memory space of this F00000H ~ is as it is
As it can not be used, execute attached F.EXE to access the area from F00000H.
There is a need to.Also, when using Power Window via I / O expansion unit, many
If this memory space can not be used.In this case, if you use auto setup,
Examine the space and configure it if it is available.When performing manual setup,
If the memory space can not be used when using the I / O expansion unit, etc.
Select "Use".However, the display of 16.77 million colors is not possible, and the drawing speed is slightly reduced.
When changing the memory space, PW801928.INI editing and S1 in PowerWindow801 / 801 +
Need to change (the latter is not necessary with PowerWindow 928).However, the main unit mounted memory exceeds 13.6 MB
You can not change it.
Example: Setting to use E00000H to 128KB
1. PW 801 928.Change WinAddr = 240 in INI to WinAddr = 224.
2. Change S1 to ON-ON-ON-ON-ON-OFF-OFF-OFF.
※ When used in the compatible mode, this switch is for setting in the NEC compatible mode.

・ 3 jumper switch JP1: setting of compatibility mode of PowerWindow 928
PowerWindow 928 is NEC's PC-9801-85 (Window accelerator board B) and EPSON
There is a mode that uses a driver for PCHKB2.Two pins short on the N side of JP1
In the NEC compatible mode, if you short the two pins on the E side, the EPSON compatible mode is established.

-6 stations dip switch S2: setting of compatible mode of PowerWindow 928
NEC compatible with EPSON compatible mode setting and NEC / EPSON compatible mode together with S1 for NEC compatible mode setting
Make settings in.
1. NEC compatible mode
Set all S2 to ON.
The meaning of each dip of S1 is as follows
1: Display to use
　ON = non-interlaced
　OFF = interlace
2-3-4: Always ON-ON-ON
5-6: Memory space
　ON-ON = F 00000 H to F 0 FFFF H, F 8 000 to F 80 FFFH
　ON-OFF = F20000H to F2FFFFH, F88000 to F88FFFH
　OFF-ON = F40000H to F4FFFFH, F90000 to F90FFFH
　OFF-OFF = F60000H to F6FFFFH, F98000 to F98FFFH
7-8: Always ON-ON

2. EPSON compatible mode
S2 should be adjusted to the higher horizontal sync frequency within the frequency range supported by the display used
Configuration.Below, 1-2-3-4-5-6 ■ Horizontal synchronization frequency ■ Vertical synchronization frequency
ON-ON-ON-ON-ON-ON 31.5 KHz 60.0 Hz
ON-ON-ON-ON-OFF-ON 32.8 KHz 80.0 Hz
OFF-ON-OFF-ON-ON-ON 35.5 KHz 86.8 Hz
ON-OFF-OFF-ON-ON-ON 48.4 KHz 60.0 Hz

To use in compatibility mode you need 3 files: PWS.EXE, PWS.DEF, and WINP.BAT.
When the display driver for PC-9801-85 and PCHKB2 is set for each board
If it is not recognized, it can not be installed.Therefore recognize PowerWindow 928 as these boards
First run PWS.EXE to make it run:
A: \> CD WINDOWS
A: \ WINDOWS> PWS
Run it,
..No display driver definition found
......
......
Please specify the screen resolution from this =?
The message will be displayed, so specify the resolution you want to use.Now the display
Driver installation is possible.
Compatibility mode is
A: \> CD WINDOWS
A: \ WINDOWS> WINP
Start with.

・ Two jumpers JP3: VRAM capacity specification
Short when adding VRAM expansion kit to Power Window 928.
